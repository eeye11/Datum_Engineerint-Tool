/*
 * SETTING THE DRAWING SCALE.
 *
 * A drawing's coordinates are numbers until somebody says how big one
 * of them is. Until then a 100-unit line could be 100 mm, 100 inches
 * or 100 parsecs, and a dimension has no honest number to print.
 *
 * Rather than print a guess with a "~" in front of it forever, the
 * FIRST dimension is what establishes the scale. That is the natural
 * moment: the student has just measured something they can put a ruler
 * against, so it is exactly when they know the answer.
 *
 * The dialog asks for two things and nothing else:
 *
 *   - the REAL distance of the geometry that was just measured
 *   - the unit that distance is in
 *
 * Both are needed. A number alone is ambiguous, and guessing the unit
 * is precisely the mistake this exists to prevent.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT ASK
 * ----------------------------------
 * It never asks the student to restate the DRAWING length. They are
 * shown what it is; typing it back would invite a typo that silently
 * rescales the whole document. Only the side they cannot be expected
 * to know is asked for.
 *
 * WHY A MODULE AND NOT A prompt()
 * -------------------------------
 * A browser prompt cannot express two fields, cannot offer a unit
 * list, cannot say what is about to happen, and looks nothing like the
 * rest of the application. More importantly it is a modal the browser
 * owns: it cannot be styled, it steals focus wholesale, and it is easy
 * to dismiss by accident - which here would mean losing a dimension
 * without meaning to.
 *
 * The dialog is cancellable, Escape-aware, and leaves nothing behind.
