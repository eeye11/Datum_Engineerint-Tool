 * ============================================================
 * WHAT EACH FEATURE TYPE IS
 * ============================================================
 *
 * One entry per stored feature type (the `type` field of a feature),
 * declaring the groups it belongs to. Code that needs to know "is this a
 * support?" or "can a load attach to this?" asks the predicates below,
 * rather than keeping its own list of type names - so adding a type, or
 * moving one between groups, is one edit here instead of a hunt through
 * every module that once listed it.
 *
 * TRAITS
 * ------
 *   body        a Statics body that other Statics features attach to
 *               (supports, loads, moments, connections)
 *   attachable  a Statics feature that can be attached to a body
 *   support     a support (pin, roller, fixed, smooth)
 *   connection  a connection between bodies (pin, fixed, slider)
 *   vector      drawn with the shared vector arrows, so it carries the
 *               Statics vector display settings
 *   spanShaped  a straight member between two ends: hit-tested and
 *               box-selected along its span rather than as an area
 *
 * The order of entries is meaningful where a list is derived from it:
 * typesWith("body") lists bodies in the order the Statics tools offer
 * them.

     *
     * `spanShaped`  a straight member between two ends: measured along its
     *               span rather than as an area.
     * `body`        something a load, support or connection attaches to.
     * `vector`      drawn as an arrow whose length is the shared Vector Scale.
     * `pointLike`   an engineering node drawn AT a position.
     * `area`        a closed outline, selected as a shape rather than a span.
     *
     * A TYPE MISSING FROM HERE FALLS TO THE LAST-RESORT TEST, which asks only
     * whether one of its defining POINTS is inside a selection rectangle. That
     * fallback is honest but weak: a long polyline crossing a box is not
     * "inside" it, so a feature the registry has not heard of can be clickable
     * and yet impossible to sweep up. That is what `polyline` did.
