 * ========================================================

 * new beam drawn on the emptied sheet was silently measured with a
 * calibration established by geometry that no longer exists - the
 * student would be told a length nobody could account for.
 *
 * So the scale is dropped automatically, with no command for the
 * student to find, and the sheet's next first length establishes a
 * new one. That is the same rule the first length used to follow,
 * applied from the other end.
 *
 * ONLY THE ACTIVE SHEET IS CONSIDERED. The scale belongs to a
 * sheet, so emptying this one says nothing about any other: a
 * second sheet with its own calibration keeps it.
 *
 * WHAT COUNTS AS GEOMETRY
 * -----------------------
 * Things a student DREW that have a LENGTH: the bodies, the shapes,
 * the construction geometry, the reference geometry.
 *
 * Not the things that merely describe what was drawn. A dimension,
 * a moment, a load, a support or an analysis diagram is a reading of
 * some geometry, and deleting that geometry already takes it with
 * it - the deletion above removes descendants, and these are exactly
 * the kind of dependent that has a parent. If they were counted
 * here, a sheet holding a lone orphaned annotation would keep a
 * calibration alive with no drawing behind it, and the sheet would
 * never reset.
 *
 * AND NOT A FORCE. This is a LENGTH scale - the relationship between
 * a sheet's drawing units and real lengths - so only geometry that
 * HAS a length can hold one. A Point Force carries a magnitude in
 * newtons, not a distance: a force left alone on an otherwise empty
 * sheet is a sheet with no length on it, and a length scale there
 * would be calibrating something that is not present. The rule is
 * the one the first-length calibration already follows - the first
 * valid force magnitude does not establish the length scale - and it
 * is symmetric, because a sheet that could not be emptied while a
 * lone force sat on it would never reset.
