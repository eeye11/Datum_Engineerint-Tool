 * ========================================================
 * HOW CLOSE THE CURSOR MUST BE TO SNAP TO A NAMED POINT
 * ========================================================
 *
 * Five pixels, and the argument for a small number is not that a
 * large one is wrong but that a large one is UNRECOVERABLE.
 *
 * A generous tolerance is usually defended as being kind to a
 * trackpad user who cannot land on a pixel. But the cost of being
 * generous is not paid by the person who wanted the wider band; it is
 * paid by the person lining a member up PAST a row of features, who
 * finds the next one along grabbing the cursor a dozen pixels clear of
 * it. There is no way to recover from that except to move further
 * away and try again, and the further away they go to escape it the
 * more likely they are to be caught by something else. A tolerance
 * that is too wide cannot be worked around; one that is too narrow
 * can, by zooming in.
 *
 * IT WAS FIFTEEN, AND THAT IS THE STICKINESS THAT WAS REPORTED.
 *
 * Fifteen pixels is about the width of a support symbol and wider
 * than the gap between two ordinary snap targets on a dense beam, so
 * the feature being passed was more likely to be caught than missed.
 * Fifteen is a number that feels reasonable in isolation and is
 * unusable in practice, which is why it survived being written down
 * as deliberate.
 *
 * Five is still forgiving - it is five screen pixels, at any zoom,
 * because the measurement is in screen space and the zoom is already
 * applied to the coordinates being compared - and it is narrow enough
 * that a cursor travelling along a member passes its targets instead
 * of being captured by them.
 *
 * THE TRUSS MULTIPLIER IS GONE WITH IT, and that is deliberate. It
 * widened the tolerance for truss work because truss joints sit close
 * together - which is an argument for aiming better, not for a
 * catch radius wide enough to make the wrong joint likely. A truss is
 * now snapped with the same 5 px as everything else, so a snap that
 * works on a beam works identically on a truss, and there is no
 * second tolerance in the system to remember which rule applied.

/*
 * How far off horizontal or vertical the cursor may be and

 *
 * SEVEN DEGREES. It is the band a drafting package conventionally
 * uses, and it is tight for the same reason the snap tolerance is
 * tight: an inference that catches the cursor too early takes the
 * decision away from the user, who then has to move further out to
 * escape it - and the further out they go, the more likely they are
 * to be caught by something else instead.
 *
 * It was 12 degrees, which reads as a small difference and is not
 * one: at a 200 mm chord the 12-degree band is about 42 mm wide, so
 * a member intended 10 degrees off horizontal was silently snapped
 * flat. The indicator said "Horizontal" and the geometry was not
 * what the student drew.
 *
 * Wider than the 5 px point tolerance because alignment is a
 * DIRECTION rather than a place: the user is lining a member up with
 * a chord, and the chord is often long and thin, so aiming precisely
 * along it is harder than aiming at its end. That is an argument for
 * a few degrees more than the point tolerance, not for a band wide

 *
 * A per-tool tolerance is a way of saying "this tool needs to be
 * less accurate", and the consequence is that a snap behaves
 * differently depending on which tool is armed while doing the same
 * kind of aim. That is the definition of a rule a user has to learn
 * and cannot see: they aim at a joint on a truss, get caught, move
 * slightly, and get caught by a different one - with nothing on
 * screen to say the tolerance had changed underneath them.
 *
 * One tolerance for the whole sheet is the only version of this that
 * is predictable, and predictable is what snapping is for. A tool
 * that genuinely needs a wider catch is a tool whose TARGETS are too
 * close together, and the answer to that is better candidates or a

                 * is a distinction the tools can act on. Adding the

     * A CANDIDATE THAT IS A LINE IS NOT AN ALIGNMENT REFERENCE.
     *
     * Alignment works by comparing the pointer with a single point
     * on each candidate and then pulling the pointer onto its axis.
     * A candidate with no point - a centreline, published as a line
     * so a support can be placed anywhere along it - has no axis to
     * align to, so reading one throws.
     *
     * This is not a rare path: the references below are the same
     * candidate list the snap search uses, so every snap that got
     * far enough to look for inference met a centreline. The throw
     * happened inside the alignment code, a long way from the
     * candidate that caused it and giving no hint that the
     * centreline was involved.
     *
     * Alignment is a property of POINTS, so line candidates are
     * skipped here and nothing is lost: a centreline still snaps
     * as a snap, and what a student aligns to is a point they have
     * already placed rather than a member they are standing on.

 * HOW LONG A GUIDE OUTLASTS THE CURSOR
 * ========================================================
 *
 * A GENEROUS FIGURE WAS THE WRONG TRADE, and it is the reason snapping
 * was reported as sticky rather than merely too sensitive.
 *
 * The argument for a hold was that a drafting aid which vanishes the
 * instant it stops being exactly true is not a drafting aid. That is
 * true of a guide that DISAPPEARS, and it is not true of this one: the
 * snap has already been taken by the time the guide is drawn. The
 * guide is a picture of a decision, not the decision.
 *
 * So what a long hold actually did was show a student a "Horizontal"
 * or "Midpoint" label for a target their cursor had plainly left -
 * three hundred milliseconds of the tool claiming something untrue -
 * which reads as the snap being unreliable in exactly the way the
 * original complaint describes. The status bar made it worse, because
 * the label is text: text persists in the eye far longer than a line
 * does, so the reported symptom was a snap status stuck on screen
 * while the pointer was somewhere else entirely.
 *
 * A SHORT HOLD ONLY. Long enough that a single jittery frame does not
 * make the guide strobe, short enough that leaving the target clears
 * it before the eye can read the old one as current.

 * ========================================================
 * HOW LONG A SNAP ITSELF OUTLASTS THE CURSOR

 * NOT AT ALL, and that is the important half.
 *
 * The guide above is a picture; this is the value. When the cursor
 * leaves every target, the snap must become null in that same frame -
 * the point the student is about to place is the cursor, not wherever
 * they were a moment ago.
 *
 * There is no grace period on the snap, and no remembered candidate,
 * because a snap carried over from a previous frame is a point the
 * student never aimed at being used as though they had.

 * found is the true answer for this frame and any older guide is by
 * definition stale.
 *
 * The ONLY question is what to draw when nothing fresh was found: the
 * previous guide for the length of a very short hold, or nothing.
 *
 * IT IS NOT A MATTER OF WHAT THE PREVIOUS GUIDE WAS.
 *
 * This used to end with two branches that both returned `fresh` - one
 * of them behind a `sameInferenceTarget` test whose two exits were
 * identical. So the test decided nothing at all, and the code said so
 * without ever saying it: it read as though a settled guide were held
 * while the cursor ranged around its target, when in fact the hold
 * below was unconditional. A branch that cannot change the answer is
 * not a branch, and leaving it in place guarantees the next reader
