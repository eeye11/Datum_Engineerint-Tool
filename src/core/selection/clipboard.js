 * The drawing clipboard.
 *
 * Copy, paste and cut work on whole features rather than on
 * geometry types, so a Point Force comes back with its
 * magnitude, its direction and its appearance, and a
 * distributed load comes back with its profile. That is why
 * this module stores the complete feature rather than a
 * drawing-specific summary of it: whatever a feature needs in
 * order to exist, it has.
 *
 * A pasted feature is genuinely NEW. It gets a fresh identity,
 * it is renumbered by the normal add path, and it is placed at
 * an offset so it is visibly a copy rather than a duplicate
 * sitting exactly on the original. Its link to a body is
 * re-pointed at the copied body where one was copied with it,
 * so a body and the load on it stay together.
