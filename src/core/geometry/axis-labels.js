 *
 * Where a coordinate system's X and Y labels are DRAWN.
 *
 * This is a leaf module on purpose. The renderer draws the labels, the hit test
 * picks them, and the drag writes them; all three must agree about where a label
 * is. If any one of them computed the position itself they could disagree, and
 * the symptom would be a label that cannot be clicked where it is drawn - the
 * worst kind of defect, because it looks like the click was ignored.
 *
 * It imports NOTHING. Putting this in the hit-testing module instead pulled the
 * editor's import graph into the renderer and made a cycle that broke start-up,
 * which is exactly the kind of coupling a small shared leaf avoids.
