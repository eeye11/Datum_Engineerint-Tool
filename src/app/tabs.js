     * ========================================================
     * A TAB THAT BECOMES VISIBLE HAS ITS SIZE FOR THE FIRST TIME
     * ========================================================
     *
     * The drawing canvas is measured from its own element on every render
     * - `clientWidth`, `clientHeight`, a bounding rectangle - because the
     * renderer has to know how much drawing area there is before it can
     * project anything into it.
     *
     * A CSS `display: none` section has NO box: its width and height are
     * both zero. So a render performed while the drawing tab is hidden
     * lays the sheet out into a 0 x 0 viewport, and the result is a canvas
     * that stays blank until something else happens to redraw it - which
     * is exactly the "the drawing only appears after a resize" defect.
     *
     * Bringing the section on screen is precisely the moment its real size
     * first exists, so this is where the redraw belongs. It is a real
     * redraw of a now-measurable viewport, not a delay standing in for
     * one: no timer is involved, and the size is read after the class
     * change above has made the section visible.
     *
     * The camera is left exactly as it was. A redraw is not a re-fit, so
     * the student's zoom and pan survive switching tabs - only the number
     * of pixels the same view is drawn into changes.
