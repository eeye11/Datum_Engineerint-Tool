/*
 * The Annotation object.
 *
 * An annotation DESCRIBES something. A dimension measures it. That is
 * the whole distinction this system turns on, and this module is the
 * other half of it:
 *
 *     "how long is this beam"      -> a Dimension
 *     "250 N at 30 degrees"        -> an Annotation
 *     "assume negligible self-weight"  -> an Annotation
 *
 * So nothing here computes a length, and nothing in the dimension
 * module computes a force. A Point Force has a magnitude, a direction
 * and an application point, and they are three different kinds of
 * fact: the point is geometry and can be dimensioned, while the
 * magnitude and direction are engineering values that only exist
 * because the student put them there. This module states them; it never
 * derives them.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE ONE THING THIS MODULE EXISTS TO GET RIGHT
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * An annotation is a LABEL ATTACHED TO A FEATURE, not a child of it.
 * The student must be able to grab "250 N" and drag it to the other
 * side of the sheet while the force arrow stays exactly where it was,
 * and the label must keep updating from the force afterwards:
 *
 *     Point Force            Annotation "250 N"
 *          \                 at x = 300, y = 150
 *           \
 *            \                sourceFeatureId: pointForce_004
 *             *
 *
 * Move the annotation to x = 450, y = 100. The force does not move.
 * The annotation still says 250 N because it still points at the
 * force. Change the force to 300 N and the annotation says 300 N,
 * still at x = 450, because the student put it there and that choice
 * is theirs.
 *
 * Two properties, therefore, that must never be confused:
 *
 *     sourceFeatureId     WHO the annotation is about
 *     placement           WHERE the annotation sits
 *
 * Moving the annotation changes the second and must not touch the
 * first. Changing the source's value changes what the annotation SAYS
 * and must not touch the second. Conflating them is the failure this
 * module's whole design exists to prevent, so placement is stored with
 * an explicit record of whether the student chose it - and a placement
 * the student chose is never moved again on their behalf.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * GENERATED VERSUS WRITTEN
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * A GENERATED annotation derives its text from the feature: a force's
 * magnitude, a moment's sense, a support's name. Change the feature
 * and the text follows, because the text is not stored - it is read
 * from the feature every time it is asked for, the same way a
 * dimension's value is measured rather than remembered.
 *
 * A WRITTEN annotation is the student's own words. "Assume negligible
 * self-weight" is not derived from anything, so editing it is normal
 * text editing and moving it does nothing to any feature.
 *
 * Both keep their text separate from their placement, so a written
 * annotation that the student has positioned still does not become
 * associated with anything just by being near it.

 * `describes` is the honest answer to "may this label be written on

 * this feature". It is declared here rather than worked out from the data,

 * a force does, and probing for one alone would happily label a moment

 * "F = 500 N", which calls a moment a force and means it.

 * So a kind states what it describes, and kindsFor offers only those.

 * A new feature type opts in by naming itself here - in one place, next to
