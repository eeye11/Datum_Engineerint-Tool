/* Engineering drawing analysis dependencies - the one update mechanism. */
/*
 * An Analysis object is a READING OF OTHER FEATURES, not a mark on the
 * sheet. A Force Components is a reading of one Point Force; a
 * Resultant is a reading of several; an SFD's reference axis is a
 * reading of a Beam's span.
 *
 * That relationship is the whole feature, and it used to be copied
 * rather than held. Each Analysis object stored the numbers it had at
 * the moment it was created and nothing else, so moving the Point
 * Force left the components behind describing where it used to be,
 * and the only way to fix it was to delete the analysis and build it
 * again. Worse, the relationship lived in whatever had to be edited:
 * making a force follow its source would have meant remembering to
 * add a branch to every handler that can move a force.
 *
 * So there is exactly ONE place that knows how to keep an Analysis
 * object true: `refreshAnalysis`. Everything else registers a
 * dependency and forgets about it.
 *
 * WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO
 * -------------------------------
 * It recomputes from values that EXPLICITLY EXIST on the source
 * features. It never solves for anything. A missing shear value, an
 * unknown support reaction and the shape of a student's bending curve
 * are not derivable from the drawing without being the exercise, so
 * this file will not attempt them - see `deriveForceComponents` and
 * `deriveResultant` for the line between reading a value and inventing
 * one.

 * the sheet's scale depend on the units the student typed. That is
 * true of the STORED number and false of the DRAWING: 250 N and
 * 0.25 kN are the same force, and a sheet that draws them at
 * different sizes cannot show that they are the same force.
 *
 * So the length is now derived from the magnitude the same way a
 * force's own arrow is, through the one shared Statics Vector Scale.
 * The 30 units are kept as the REFERENCE: a resultant of 30 in the
 * drawing's own units draws at 30, exactly as before, so nothing that
 * looked right changes size. What changes is that a resultant ten
 * times bigger now draws ten times longer, which is what makes a
 * resultant comparable with the forces it is made of.
 *
 * The factor is applied to the whole vector rather than to each axis
 * separately, so the DIRECTION is untouched: scaling x and y
 * independently would turn a resultant of (30, 40) into something
 * that is no longer 30, 40 at all.
 */
/*
 * THE UNITS AT WHICH THE RESULTANT IS DRAWN.
 *
 * One unit of the sum is one unit on the sheet, so a 500 N resultant

 * is what makes a resultant comparable with the forces it is made of.
 *
 * ========================================================
 * THE SAME UNIT CONVERSION A POINT FORCE USES
 * ========================================================
 *
 * The factor is the one a Point Force uses, so a resultant is
 * comparable with the forces it is made of by looking at them.
 *
 * IT WAS A THOUSANDTH OF ITS OWN, and that is why every resultant was
 * a stub. A 300 N resultant drew as 0.3 units - about a twentieth of a
 * pixel - so what appeared on the sheet was a dot with an arrowhead on
 * it, and the direction was the only thing it could possibly convey.
 * The separate factor had a reason written beside it (statics forces
 * are hundreds of newtons and the sheet is in millimetres), but the
 * Point Force solves the same problem by a different route and does not
 * need it: its stored magnitude IS its drawn length, scaled by the
 * shared Vector Scale.
 *
 * So the resultant uses that same rule rather than a second opinion
 * about what a newton is worth in millimetres. Two conversions for one
 * quantity is how a feature ends up drawn at a different scale from the
 * thing it describes - which is a diagram claiming a magnitude it does
