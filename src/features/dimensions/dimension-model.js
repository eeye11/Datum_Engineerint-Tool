/*
 * The Dimension object.
 *
 * A dimension is a MEASUREMENT OF GEOMETRY, and this module is the
 * whole of what that means. It deliberately knows nothing about
 * engineering values: a force's magnitude is an annotation, and no
 * code in here can produce one. That separation is the distinction the
 * entire system turns on - geometry is what a dimension measures,
 * engineering meaning is what an annotation states - and keeping the
 * two in separate modules is what makes it a rule rather than a
 * convention.
 *
 * WHY A DIMENSION STORES REFERENCES AND NOT A NUMBER
 * -------------------------------------------------
 * The obvious implementation stores the measured value: the user
 * dimensions a 100 line, "100" is saved, and the drawing shows 100.
 * It is smaller, simpler, and wrong. The moment the line moves the
 * dimension still says 100, and nothing in the file records that the
 * number used to mean something about that line.
 *
 * So a dimension stores WHERE it measured - which feature, and which
 * named part of it - and recalculates every time it is drawn. Moving
 * the line changes the measurement because the measurement was never
 * stored in the first place. Association is not a mechanism kept
 * up to date; it is the absence of a cached value.
 *
 * WHAT A REFERENCE IS
 * ------------------
 *     { featureId, anchor, part? }
 *
 * A one-point reference (a radius, a coordinate) names one anchor. A
 * two-point reference (a length, an angle) names two. `part` exists
 * for measurements taken from a feature's own dimensions rather than
 * its anchors - a shaft's diameter, a circle's radius - so that
 * changing the shaft's diameter changes the dimension that states it.
 *
 * THE VALUE IS NEVER TYPED IN
 * ---------------------------
 * There is no way to set a dimension's value from this module, and
 * that is deliberate. A dimension states what the geometry is. If a
 * student typed "50 mm" onto a 100 mm line, the drawing would then
 * contain a claim that is false and nothing to show it is false.
 * Establishing the real relationship between drawing units and
 * millimetres is the scale module's job, and it is a separate,
 * explicit act.
 *
 * UNRESOLVED, NOT STALE
 * ---------------------
 * When a source feature is deleted, its anchor can no longer resolve.
 * The dimension is marked unresolved and says so, rather than
 * continuing to display the last number it knew. A stale number on a
 * drawing is worse than an obvious gap: it looks like an answer.

 * but a dimension saved before that, or built directly by a caller, may carry
 * only the first - and such a reference is still perfectly clear about which
 * edge it means. Deriving the partner anchor keeps those working rather than
 * silently falling back to the feature span.

 * `theta` from it, where 0 <= theta <= 180. The four sectors are bounded by
 * the four directions: the reference's two ends, and the other axis's two
