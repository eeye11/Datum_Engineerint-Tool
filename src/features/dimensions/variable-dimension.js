/*
 * ========================================================
 * THE VARIABLE DIMENSION
 * ========================================================
 *
 * A dimension STATES a measured quantity. A Variable Dimension NAMES an unknown
 * one:
 *
 *     Smart Dimension          Variable Dimension
 *     ───────────────          ──────────────────
 *     500 mm                   x
 *     25 mm                    L
 *     50°                      θ
 *     Ø100 mm                  R
 *
 * That difference is the whole reason this is a separate feature rather than a
 * differently-styled dimension. A dimension MEASURES - the number comes from the
 * geometry and changes when the geometry does. A variable is SYMBOLIC - the
 * student writes `x` and it means "the unknown", and nothing about the drawing
 * can compute it or should try to.
 *
 * WHY IT IS NOT A DIMENSION WITH AN EMPTY VALUE
 * ---------------------------------------------
 * A measured dimension with no measurement is a broken dimension: the value is
 * unknown because something failed. A variable's value is unknown ON PURPOSE, and
 * that is a complete, correct state. Rendering one as `0` or `?` - which is what
 * happens when a symbolic quantity is pushed through a numeric field - turns the
 * student's own statement into an error message.
 *
 * WHAT IT SHARES WITH A DIMENSION
 * -------------------------------
 * Everything except the value. It attaches to the same geometry through the same
 * reference kinds, sits at a placement the student chose, is drawn by the same
 * renderer in the same style, persists in the same file, and is selected and
 * moved in the same way. A variable is an engineering statement about the
 * drawing, not a note beside it, so it belongs to the drawing's own geometry
 * model rather than to the written side.

 * The default symbol a new variable is created with.
