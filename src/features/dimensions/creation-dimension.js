/*
 * ============================================================
 * CREATION-TIME DIMENSION INPUT
 * ============================================================
 *
 * When a student draws something that has a physical size, the
 * natural moment to say how big it is has just passed: the
 * geometry is on the screen, the shape is settled, and the one
 * thing still unknown is what the number means.
 *
 * This module is the INPUT for that moment. It is one compact
 * inline popup, not a modal dialog and not a settings page, that
 * asks for one engineering quantity and then - for a shape that
 * genuinely has two - a second one. Enter commits the current
 * field; for a two-value shape Enter on the first advances to
 * the second. Escape abandons the whole thing.
 *
 * WHAT IT DELIBERATELY IS NOT
 * ---------------------------
 * It is NOT a second scale system. It knows nothing about world
 * units, calibration or conversion. It collects a NUMBER AND A
 * UNIT from the student and hands the structured quantity back.
 * Whoever called it decides what that quantity means - because that
 * is a question about geometry, and this module is only a question
 * about input.
 *
 * THE UNIT IS PART OF THE ANSWER, NOT PART OF THE DECORATION
 * ----------------------------------------------------------
 * The student is TYPING a physical length, so the number they type
 * only means something once they say what unit it is in. "500" is
 * half a metre, five metres or half a millimetre, and the drawing
 * has no way to guess which was meant. So the unit is a control
 * they can change, and the pair - value plus unit - is the answer
 * that is handed back:
 *
 *     [{ value: 0.5, unit: "m" }, ...]
 *
 * That is why this is a SELECT and not a printed label. A label
 * would tell the student what unit their number is being read as
 * and offer them no say in it, which is precisely the mistake this
 * design avoids: entering 500 while the box said mm is not a
 * millimetre beam because the box said so.
 *
 * IT IS STILL NOT THE ANNOTATION UNIT DISPLAY
 * --------------------------------------------
 * Whether a force is annotated "100 N" or just "100" is a
 * per-feature display setting, decided somewhere else entirely and
 * applied to the drawing. It has nothing to do with which unit the
 * student is typing a length in, and the two never meet: this
 * control exists only while a creation popup is open, and it
 * disappears with the popup.
 *
 * THE VALUE THE FIELD STARTS WITH IS A SUGGESTION
 * -----------------------------------------------
 * computed by the caller and expressed in the unit the field is
 * currently set to. It is shown in exactly the same style as a
 * typed value and it never carries a "~": a suggestion is a real
 * engineering quantity the student can accept by pressing Enter,
 * and marking it as approximate would say the document does not
 * know what the number is - which is the opposite of true.
 *
 * WHY IT IS SEPARATE FROM scale-calibration.js
 * --------------------------------------------
 * The scale dialog asks a different question ("what is this
 * thing really?") in a different place (a modal, because the
 * document has no scale yet and nothing else can proceed). This
 * asks "how big is the thing I just made?" inline, while the
 * student is still looking at it, and its answer is usually a
 * property of the new feature rather than of the document. They
 * share the unit list and the quantity formatter and nothing
 * else, which is the right amount of sharing.
 */

/*
 * A confirmation that has just happened, and whether the keyboard
 * event that caused it has finished travelling.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NEEDED
 * ------------------
 * Confirming removes the popup from the document BEFORE running
 * the caller's callback. That is deliberate - it means the canvas
 * is clear while the geometry is committed, and that a callback
 * which throws cannot leave an orphaned input behind.
 *
 * But it has a consequence the popup cannot fix on its own. The
 * keydown that confirmed the value is still bubbling when that
 * removal happens, and by the time it reaches the document handler
 * the field it was typed in no longer exists. Anything that decides
 * "is the user typing?" by asking about the focused element now
 * gets the wrong answer, and a canvas shortcut that means
 * something else entirely can fire on the very keystroke that set
 * the feature's size.
 *
 * So the popup stops the key from travelling any further: the
 * keydown handlers on the input call `stopPropagation`, which is
 * what every dialog in the application already does with the keys
 * it owns. A dialog that does not stop a key is a dialog that
 * leaks its keystrokes to the canvas behind it.
 *
 * There is deliberately no "recently consumed" flag here. One was
 * tried and removed: it has to be cleared at some point, and every
 * way of choosing that point is a race - clear it early and the
 * canvas shortcut fires on the confirming Enter, clear it late and
 * it swallows the next, unrelated key and stops the next tool from
 * being chosen. Stopping the event is exact: it lasts precisely as
 * long as the event does, and not one millisecond longer.
