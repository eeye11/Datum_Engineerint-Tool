/*
 * ============================================================
 * THE MENU BAR AND ITS DROPDOWNS
 * ============================================================
 *
 * One component, used by all six menus. A menu declares WHAT it contains - a
 * list of items and separators - and this module decides how a menu behaves:
 * how it opens, how it closes, how it is drawn, and how the keyboard drives it.
 *
 * WHY IT IS ONE COMPONENT AND NOT SIX MENUS
 * -----------------------------------------
 * Six menus written separately are six chances to disagree about the same
 * things - when a click closes the previous menu, whether Escape works, where
 * the shadow sits, how tall an item is. Every one of those is a detail nobody
 * chose; they are just where the copies drifted. So the behaviour lives here
 * once, and the six menus are DATA.
 *
 * THE FOUR RULES THAT MAKE A MENU FEEL RIGHT
 * ------------------------------------------
 *   1. clicking a label opens it;
 *   2. clicking ANOTHER label moves to that one without a second click - the
 *      pointer is already over the bar, so that is what it means;
 *   3. clicking outside, or Escape, closes it;
 *   4. running a command closes it.
 *
 * THE MENU MUST NOT MOVE THE PAGE. It is a positioned overlay inside the bar,
 * drawn above the canvas, so opening it cannot reflow the layout beneath it -
 * no toolbar scooting sideways, no canvas resizing as a menu appears. That is
 * why the panel is `position: absolute` under its own label and the bar itself
 * never changes size.
 *
 * WHAT A COMMAND IS
 * -----------------
 * An item is `{ id, label, run, disabled, shortcut, checked, group }`. `run` is
 * the command itself - a function somebody else owns. This module never knows
 * what "Save" does; it only calls it. That is the whole point: the menu is a
 * front door onto commands that already exist, not a second implementation of
 * them.
