/*
 * ========================================================
 * THE SKETCH EDITOR
 * ========================================================
 *
 * The other half of the Analysis Editor. A Plot is entered as equations
 * and a Sketch is drawn by hand, and both are reached from the same place
 * - openAnalysisEditorFor - so a student who placed an SFD and a BMD works
 * the same dialog either way, in the mode their feature was created in.
 *
 * FOUR TOOLS, AND ONLY FOUR
 * ------------------------
 *
 * Select, Straight Line, Curve, Erase.
 *
 * The general Geometry toolbar is deliberately NOT offered here. It is
 * built for a drawing sheet, where a rectangle or a construction line is a
 * normal thing to want. Here the student is sketching the SHAPE of one
 * diagram, and offering them forty tools to do it makes the obvious one
 * harder to find. Everything the sketch needs - two points and a pen - is
 * on those four buttons, and a Rectangle would be a Line with one more
 * click.
 *
 * DRAWING IS ENGINEERING, NOT PIXELS
 * ---------------------------------
 *
 * A point is stored as an engineering (x, y) in the graph's own
 * coordinate system - x being the source body's longitudinal station, and
 * y the value on the vertical axis. The screen mapping happens once, when
 * the graph is drawn. A sketch made at one zoom therefore reads identically
 * at another, which is the only way it can be measured later.
 *
 * THE STUDENT NEVER TYPES A COORDINATE.
 *
 * They click, and the click is resolved through the same scale the
 * axes are drawn with. Exact values are still available - on the element
 * list, once something is selected - but they are a way of checking the
 * work, not a way of doing it. Asking someone to type "x = 250" to place
 * a point at 250 is a way of making the graph harder to use than it needs
 * to be.
 *
 * A VERTICAL LINE IS JUST A LINE.
 *
 * There is no Vertical Jump tool. A Straight Line whose ends share an x is
 * a vertical line, and it is stored as one, so nothing has to convert it
 * afterwards and there is no second thing to get wrong.
 *
 * APPLY IS ONE HISTORY STEP.
 *
 * Nothing here touches the document until Apply. The preview callback
 * shows the work on the sheet while it is being done, exactly as the Plot
 * editor does, so Cancel genuinely cancels.

 * The drawing frame.
 *
 * WIDER AND TALLER THAN THE PLOT EDITOR'S, because a sketch is read as a

 * making this bigger would only enlarge the frame around an unchanged graph.

 * ENGINEERING <-> SCREEN, AND WHY IT IS FIXED FOR THE SESSION.
 *
 * One function, used by everything that draws and everything that reads a
 * click, so the two can never disagree.
 *
 * THE Y SCALE IS CHOSEN ONCE AND DOES NOT CHANGE while the sketch is open.
 *
 * That is the whole of the "the geometry runs away from the mouse" defect.
 * The scale used to be derived from the CURRENT elements' height on every
 * redraw - so the moment a point was dragged upward, the peak grew, the
 * scale changed, and every point on the graph MOVED. The point under the
 * cursor was therefore never where the cursor was: the student aimed at a
 * spot, the graph rescaled beneath them, and the shape shot off. It is also
 * why the axes appeared to jump and why a sketch with nothing in it had an
 * arbitrary height.
 *
 * So the vertical extent comes from `chooseScale` below, which is called ONCE
 * for the session and then used unchanged. Adding, moving or deleting an
 * element cannot move the graph, and the mapping
 *
 *     mouse position -> graph coordinate -> drawn geometry
 *
 * is stable for as long as the editor is open.

 *
 * It used to be the largest ABSOLUTE value - `peak * 1.35` - which is a
 * different question and gave a different answer. `Math.abs` throws the SIGN
 * away, so a diagram drawn entirely BELOW the axis was measured by how far
 * above it something might have been, and the extent below was whatever that
 * number happened to be. A trough at -40 under a peak at -5 gave an axis 54
 * units long with 49 of them wasted.

 * larger of the two distances from the axis - which is what makes the graph
 * reach the extremum on BOTH sides without leaving a band of empty space on
 * the side nothing is drawn on.
 *
 * THE MARGIN IS SMALL AND PROPORTIONAL. `1.12` rather than `1.35`: the axis
 * reaches just past the geometry, so a label at the top is not sitting on the
 * curve, without the large fixed band of unused graph the old factor left. A
 * diagram that grows to touch its own axis is a diagram whose axis is the right
 * size.
 *
 * AND THE CURVE'S REAL EXTREMA ARE USED. A quadratic bulges BEYOND its control
 * points - the drawn curve is pulled toward the Bend, not through it - so
 * testing only the stored points can clip the top of a bow. `curveExtents`
 * solves for the curve's actual maximum and minimum.

 *
 * THE BUG THIS FIXES. The graph SVG carries a `viewBox` of 0 0 900 320 and is
 * laid out with `width: 100%`, so the browser SCALES the viewBox to whatever
 * width the panel happens to be and centres it vertically (`xMidYMid meet`).
 *
 * The old code did this:
 *
 *     x: event.clientX - rect.left,
 *     y: event.clientY - rect.top,
 *
 * which is a position in RENDERED PIXELS. But `scale.fromScreen` maps from
 * VIEWBOX UNITS - the 0..WIDTH, 0..HEIGHT space the graph is drawn in. The two
 * only agree when the SVG is displayed at exactly 900x320, which it almost
 * never is: the panel is a flexible width and the element is `width: 100%`.
 *
 * So every click and every pointer move was converted through the wrong space,
 * and the error grew with the difference - which is exactly "the line being
 * drawn is not aligned with the cursor", and why it was worse in a narrower
 * panel. It also explains the letterboxing: `meet` centres the drawing, adding
 * a VERTICAL offset that a rect-relative subtraction cannot see at all.
 *
 * SO THE OFFSET IS SCALED INTO VIEWBOX UNITS, letterbox included. The ratio and
 * the centring are read from the element's own rect and the viewBox it declares,
 * so this holds for any panel width, any zoom and either aspect arrangement.
 *
 * A single ratio and two offsets, applied to the raw client point - the same
 * arithmetic the SVG's own `getScreenCTM()` performs, written out because the
 * editor also runs in a test harness where the CTM is not available.

 *      which is a different thing and not what "line it up with that station"
 *      means.
 *
 *   3. ANOTHER ELEMENT'S ENDPOINTS - so a diagram can be drawn station by
 *      station, each segment starting exactly where the last one finished,
 *      which is what makes a stepped or sloped profile come out closed.
 *
 * THE SNAP IS A MAGNET WITHIN A FEW PIXELS, never a wall: the tolerance is in

   *   the axis must REACH the drawn geometry, so a diagram is never clipped
   *   and the extent is never stale after a feature is added, moved or deleted;
   *
   *   and it must NOT chase the cursor, or a drag would rescale the graph on
   *   every pointermove and the point being dragged would run away from the
   *   mouse - the defect this editor was fixed for.
   *
   * SO IT IS RECOMPUTED AT THE END OF EVERY GESTURE AND NEVER DURING ONE. A
   * stroke being drawn, a point being dragged and an element being moved all
   * hold the scale they started with; the moment the gesture finishes - the
   * commit, the release, the delete - `refreshScale` rebuilds it from the
   * geometry as it now is. The graph therefore always fits what is drawn, and
   * never moves while the student is drawing it.
   *
   * `drawGraph` is handed the scale rather than deriving one, so there is no
   * second place that could choose a different extent.
