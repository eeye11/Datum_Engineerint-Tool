/*
 * ============================================================
 * THE LOAD MAGNITUDE POPUP
 * ============================================================
 *
 * A Distributed Load's magnitude is a physical quantity - a force per unit
 * length - and asking for it is the same kind of question the creation
 * popup asks for a length: one number, with the unit it is stated in.
 *
 * So this is a SMALL, SELF-CONTAINED POPUP that reuses the creation
 * popup's styling and conventions but offers the LOAD units - kN/m and
 * N/mm - rather than length units. It deliberately does not touch the
 * shared creation-dimension popup, which is wired to the document's length
 * units and the world scale; a load magnitude is neither.
 *
 * WHAT IT COLLECTS, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT
 * --------------------------------------
 * It collects a NUMBER AND A UNIT and hands them back:
 *
 *     { value: 5, unit: "kN/m" }
 *
 * It performs NO conversion. kN/m and N/mm are the same physical quantity -
 * one kilonewton per metre is one newton per millimetre - so the number the
 * student types is the number that is stored, and the unit travels beside
 * it. Whoever called this decides what the quantity means; this module is
 * only a question about input.
 *
 * THE STUDENT MAY TYPE THE UNIT. "5 kN/m" is read as 5 in kN/m and switches
 * the control to match, so the box never shows one unit while the value was
 * entered in another.

 * everywhere. This is the ONE reader of that answer, and it recognises the
 * three states the model already has:
 *
 *   a NUMBER     -> a numeric magnitude, exactly as typed
 *   EMPTY        -> UNKNOWN (`unknownValues[magnitudeKey]`), which the Features
 *                   panel already prints as an unknown quantity
 *   ANYTHING ELSE-> the student's own SYMBOL or expression, kept verbatim as
 *                   the feature's magnitude LABEL
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL.
 *
 * The callers each used to do `Math.max(0, Number(value) || 0)`, which turns
 * `F₁` and an empty box alike into ZERO. Zero is a measurement - "this force is
 * nothing" - and neither of those answers says that. A student who typed a
 * symbol was silently given a different statement from the one they made.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE EVALUATES AN EXPRESSION. `2*M` is not 2 times anything until the
 * student's own algebra defines M; it is what they wrote, and it is what the
 * sheet prints.
 *
 * `unit` is returned for a numeric answer only. A symbol has no unit until the
 * student gives it one, so attaching `kN` to `F₁` would be a claim they did not
 * make.

 * ============================================================
 * APPLYING THAT ANSWER TO A FEATURE
 * ============================================================
 *
 * The three states live on the feature in three places that already exist:
 * `geometry[valueKey]` for the number, `unknownValues[valueKey]` for Unknown,
 * and `magnitudeLabel` for the symbol. This writes all three consistently, so
 * a learner does not have to know which one their answer landed in.
 *
 * IT CLEARS THE OTHER TWO. A force that was `F₁` and is now `250 N` must stop
 * saying `F₁`, and one that was 250 and is now Unknown must not keep the 250
 * underneath the `?`. Setting one state without clearing the others is exactly
 * how a panel ends up showing a number beside an "Unknown" mark.
