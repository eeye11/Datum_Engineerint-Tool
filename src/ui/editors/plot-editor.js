/*
 * ========================================================
 * THE PLOT EDITOR
 * ========================================================
 *
 * A Plot is a LIST OF EXPRESSIONS, and this is the one place they are
 * created, edited and deleted. The Features panel says what the diagram
 * IS - which body it belongs to, how many expressions it holds, where it
 * sits and how it looks - and this answers what it DRAWS.
 *
 * WHY THE MATHEMATICS IS NOT IN THE PROPERTIES PANEL
 * ---------------------------------------------------
 * An SFD for a three-load beam has four or five expressions. Showing them
 * all as From/To/equation rows in the same narrow panel that also carries
 * colour, line width and position turns a property panel into a data
 * inspector: the student has to read a wall of controls to answer the one
 * question they have - "is my diagram right?" - and every keystroke in
 * that list competes with the controls around it for attention.
 *
 * So the two are separate surfaces with separate jobs. The panel is for
 * the feature's identity and appearance; this is for the mathematics, and
 * it has room for the two things that actually make it usable:
 *
 *   - the EXPRESSION CARDS, one per relation, each with only the fields
 *     that relation has - so a vertical line is never asked for an "x
 *     range" it cannot have;
 *   - the LIVE GRAPH beside them, redrawn on every keystroke, so the
 *     curve is the feedback and the text is only the input.
 *
 * THE STUDENT IS ADDING EXPRESSIONS.
 * ------------------------------------
 * That is the whole idea in one sentence, and it is why nothing here is
 * called a segment. A piecewise function is one possible arrangement of
 * several expressions; "x = 5" is an expression and is not a function of
 * x at all. Calling both a segment invites the student to look for the
 * hidden rule about which segments are joined, and there is no such rule.
 *
 * The quantity symbol is GENERATED from the diagram type - V(x), M(x) or
 * N(x) - and prepended to the field as a label. The student types
 * "10 - 5x" into a box labelled `V(x) =`; they are never asked to choose
 * a letter and never have to type the symbol themselves.
 *
 * NOTHING IS VALIDATED GLOBALLY. Each expression's problem appears on its
 * own card, because "Segment 1 needs an equation" in a separate CHECKS
 * block is a list the student has to match up by hand against the thing
 * they are editing.

   * READING THE STORED LIST AS SOMETHING TO EDIT
   * ========================================================
   *
   * An editor needs FLAT fields. The store nests a range as
   * `{xRange: {start, end}}`, which is right for the renderer and
   * awkward for a text input, and a vertical line uses a different field
   * name again. Converting between the two here means every control below
   * is a plain value and every relation's shape stays in one place.
   *
   * The id is carried through untouched. It is what a card, a delete
   * button and a saved file all use to mean the SAME expression, so the
   * visible "1" can be regenerated from the current ordering at any time
   * without anything having to be renamed.
