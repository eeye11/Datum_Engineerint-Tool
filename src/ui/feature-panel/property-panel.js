/*
 * ========================================================
 * THE SHARED FEATURE-PANEL VOCABULARY
 * ========================================================
 *
 * Every feature panel in Datum is the same argument told about different
 * engineering objects: what is this, what does it act on, what does it
 * measure, where is it, how is it drawn. That argument has a shape, and the
 * shape is not a matter of taste - it is what lets a student who has just
 * edited a beam read a Distributed Load panel without re-learning it.
 *
 * ========================================================
 * WHY THIS IS A MODULE AND NOT A CONVENTION
 * ========================================================
 *
 * The panels were not merely inconsistent; they were inconsistent in ways
 * nobody chose. Each renderer defined its own local `section`, `field`,
 * `toggle`, `readOnly` and `number` closures - fifteen near-copies of the same
 * five functions, each drifting. Two of them rounded differently. One appended
 * a unit with a trailing space whether or not a unit was passed. One built a
 * coordinate pair by string-concatenating two numbers with a comma and
 * appending "mm" to the pair, which is how a panel came to show
 *
 *     Start
 *     150, 300 mm
 *
 * and how an absent value came to leave a bare separator behind. A rule
 * followed by fifteen people is not a rule. It is fifteen decisions waiting to
 * disagree, and the punctuation was the first thing that showed it.
 *
 * So the components live here, once. A feature panel declares WHICH fields it
 * has; this module decides how every one of them looks, behaves, handles a
 * missing value, and is spaced. The feature type determines the fields. This
 * module determines everything else.
 *
 * ========================================================
 * THE TWO INVARIANTS THIS ENFORCES
 * ========================================================
 *
 * 1. NO PUNCTUATION WITHOUT A VALUE. Every text-bearing component here passes
 *    through `text()`, which drops the whole field when there is nothing to
 *    say and never emits a label with an empty value after it. A missing
 *    quantity cannot become "Direction: ," because a field with no value is
 *    not a field. This is enforced in the data-to-display layer, not hidden
 *    with CSS - the markup is not produced in the first place.
 *
 * 2. NO EMPTY SECTIONS. `section()` is buffered, not pushed. A heading whose
 *    body turned out to contain nothing is not emitted at all, so there is no
 *    APPEARANCE heading over nothing, and no leftover gap where one was
 *    removed. Sections are also ordered by construction, not by whichever
 *    feature happened to push first.
 */
/*
 * ====================================================
 * THE TEXT RULE
 * ====================================================
 *
 * One gate for every string that reaches a panel. It answers the only
 * question that produces stray punctuation: is there actually a value here?
 *
 * The checks are ordered cheapest and most-likely first. `undefined`,
 * `null` and `NaN` are the three ways a value goes missing in practice, and
 * all three stringify to something that looks like content - "undefined",
 * "null", "NaN" - which is exactly why they have to be caught rather than
 * rendered and squinted at.

/*
 * ====================================================
 * NUMBER FORMATTING, DECIDED ONCE
 * ====================================================
 *
 * The panels disagreed about decimals - some at two places, some at none -
 * so a student reading a value across two panels could not tell whether the
 * difference was engineering or display. Trailing zeros are dropped: they
 * add width without adding information, and they are what makes a panel look
 * ragged when values are listed one under another.
