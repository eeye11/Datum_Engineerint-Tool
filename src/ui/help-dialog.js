/*
 * ============================================================
 * THE HELP DIALOGS
 * ============================================================
 *
 * Four short panels: the user guide, the drawing help, the feedback route, and
 * About. One dialog and one set of content, because they are the same kind of
 * thing - a block of text the student reads and closes.
 *
 * TWO HONESTY RULES, WHICH ARE THE REASON THIS IS WRITTEN OUT
 * ----------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * 1. THE CONTENT DESCRIBES WHAT THE APPLICATION DOES. Not what it ought to do,
 *    and not what a similar program does. Every statement here is checkable
 *    against the running application, because help that describes an imagined
 *    version of the software is worse than no help at all - it sends the
 *    student looking for a control that is not there.
 *
 * 2. THE FEEDBACK ROUTE DOES NOT PRETEND. There is no server behind this
 *    application to receive a report, so offering a form that appeared to submit
 *    would be a lie the student only discovers after typing into it. The panel
 *    says what it can actually do instead - copy a diagnostic summary they can
 *    paste into wherever they are reporting the problem.
 *
 * The version comes from the DOCUMENT, so it is whatever was built. A version
 * number is the first thing anybody quotes when reporting a problem, and an
 * invented one is actively harmful.

            <h4>What DAETUM is</h4>
            <p>
                An engineering drawing and statics workspace for written
                solutions. There are two pages, chosen by the tabs at the top:
                <strong>Written Solution</strong> and
                <strong>Engineering Drawing</strong>.
            </p>

            <h4>The drawing workspace</h4>
            <p>
                The window is arranged in rows. The
                <strong>menu bar</strong> (File, Edit, Insert, View, Tools, Help)
                holds commands grouped by what they do. The
                <strong>tool bar</strong> below it holds the controls used most
                often, so they are one click away rather than two.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the left are the <strong>tools</strong> for the chosen
                category - Geometry, Annotate, Statics and others. On the right
                are the <strong>Features</strong> of whatever is selected.
            </p>

            <h4>Drawing</h4>
            <p>
                Choose a category, choose a tool, and work on the canvas. A tool
                that makes a line or a shape can be used either by
                <strong>pressing and dragging</strong> or by
                <strong>clicking twice</strong> - once for each end.
            </p>
            <p>
                Only the <strong>Select</strong> tool moves or edits work that is
                already drawn. While any other tool is active, clicking existing
                geometry does not disturb it.
            </p>

            <h4>Documents</h4>
            <p>
                <strong>File &rarr; Save</strong> writes the drawing as an
                <code>.enggdraw</code> file. A new document asks for a name the
                first time it is saved rather than overwriting anything.
            </p>
        `,
  },

  drawing: {
    title: "Drawing Help",
    body: `
            <h4>Snapping</h4>
            <p>
                While a tool is active the cursor snaps to useful points -
                endpoints, midpoints, centres and so on - and the bottom bar names
                what it has found. Snapping is controlled by the
                <strong>Snap</strong> control on the style strip, and detailed
                settings live under <strong>Tools &rarr; Precision &amp;
                Snapping</strong>.
            </p>

            <h4>Dimensions</h4>
            <p>
                A dimension measures the geometry it points at and keeps up with
                it: move the geometry and the number follows. Double-clicking a
                dimension opens the standard value box, never a scale question.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first physical length on a sheet establishes that sheet's
                <strong>scale</strong> - what a drawing unit is worth in real
                units. It is not changed by anything else.
            </p>

            <h4>Magnitudes and vector scale</h4>
            <p>
                Force and load arrows carry their values as
                <strong>magnitudes</strong>, shown or hidden by the
                <strong>Magnitudes</strong> control. <strong>Vector Scale</strong>
                changes only how large those arrows are <em>drawn</em>; it never
                changes a magnitude, a direction or any stored value.
            </p>

            <h4>Selection</h4>
            <p>
                The <strong>Select</strong> tool picks one feature; dragging on
                empty canvas draws a rectangle that picks everything it crosses.
                The selected feature's own properties appear on the right.
            </p>

            <h4>Grid</h4>
            <p>
                The grid is drawn on the canvas and toggled from
                <strong>View</strong> or the style strip. Showing the grid and
                snapping to it are separate settings - one does not turn the other
                on.
            </p>
