/*
 * Shared UI primitives for the parts of EnggDraw that float.
 *
 * Three separate features - the sheet context menu, the sheet rename
 * dialog, and whatever opens next - all need the same two things:
 * put something on screen where the user can actually see it, and get
 * out of the way cleanly. Doing that once, here, is the difference
 * between a menu that opens inward near an edge and a menu that opens
 * off it.
 *
 * WHY POSITIONING IS SHARED AND NOT PATCHED
 * -----------------------------------------
 * A menu positioned with a hard-coded offset is right in exactly one
 * place. The sheet bar is at the bottom of the workspace and the tabs
 * scroll horizontally, so "below the tab" is off-screen near the
 * bottom and "left-aligned to the tab" is off-screen near the right.
 * Patching that with a special case means the next surface to open a
 * menu re-learns the same lesson.
 *
 * So the rule lives here instead, and it is stated in one piece:
 *
 *     A floating element goes in the direction that FITS.
 *
 * It measures the real space on each side of its anchor, picks the
 * side with room, and clamps what is left. Every caller supplies an
 * anchor and gets back a position that is inside the viewport by
 * construction.
 *
 * WHY SCREEN COORDINATES, AND WHY THAT MATTERS HERE
 * ------------------------------------------------
 * Everything in this module works in SCREEN coordinates - what the
 * user sees. The drawing itself works in WORLD coordinates, and the
 * canvas has a zoom and a pan that have nothing to do with where a
 * menu appears.
 *
 * Keeping the two apart is not tidiness, it is a correctness
 * requirement: a menu that computed its position in drawing units
 * would move when the student zoomed the canvas, and would land
 * somewhere else entirely when they panned. These are UI overlays and
 * they are never part of the drawing's transform. Nothing in this
 * file reads or writes a camera, a zoom or a pan, and that is
 * deliberate.

 * ========================================================

 *
 *   openContextMenu(anchor, [{ id, label, onSelect }])
 *
 * A small menu anchored to a control - the three-dot button on a Recent file or
 * a template.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NOT A DIALOG. A dialog is MODAL: opening one closes whatever was
 * open, because there is only ever one question at a time. A context menu is
 * not a question - it belongs to the thing it is anchored to, and the surface
 * that thing lives on (the Open launcher) must stay open behind it. Routing the
 * menu through `openDialog` is what made clicking the three-dot button close
 * the Open page before the menu appeared.
 *
 * So it is a plain positioned element with no backdrop, and it dismisses on a
 * click outside itself or on Escape - neither of which touches anything else on
 * screen.

   * there and grows DOWN AND RIGHT from it, which is the direction the eye
   * expects.
   *
   * The clamp is what keeps it usable near an edge: a menu opened at the
   * bottom-right is shifted up and left until all of it is visible, rather than
   * running off the page where its items cannot be reached.
