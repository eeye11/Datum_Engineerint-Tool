 * the page when they load (the toolbar, the sheet tabs, the drawing
 * controller, the written solution), so they are imported here in the same
 * order the page used to list its <script> tags. That keeps their start-up
 * side effects in the order the application was built and tested with.

 * wiring: build the bar, and the commands are reachable.
 *
 * THE DEFINITIONS ARE PASSED AS FUNCTIONS, not as the objects they return. Each
 * menu's items move with the state - "Undo" greys out, "Hide Grid" becomes
 * "Show Grid" - so the bar evaluates them when a menu is opened rather than
