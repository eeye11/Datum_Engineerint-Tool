     * Zooming in makes TEXT bigger so it stays readable as the drawing grows,
     * and zooming out makes it smaller so it stops crowding the geometry. It
     * changes NOTHING else: lines, arrows, symbols, dimension extension lines,
     * supports, moments and every geometric position are drawn in world units
     * through the camera, exactly as they were - they already scale with zoom
     * because they ARE the drawing, and a second scaling on top of that would
     * make an arrow twice the size the student drew.
     *
     * WHY A MODULE-LEVEL VALUE RATHER THAN A PARAMETER.
     *
     * Twelve places emit a `font-size`: the annotation model, the annotate
     * features, dimension and variable-dimension text, the diagram axis labels
     * and tick numbers, and a handful inside the drawing helpers. Threading
     * `state` through every one of them - and through the helpers that do not
     * currently receive it - would be a dozen signature changes to carry one
     * number, and each would be a chance to forget one. It is set ONCE at the
     * top of every render, from the state that render was given, so it cannot
     * describe a zoom other than the one being drawn.
     *
     * IT IS READ-ONLY TO EVERYTHING BELOW. Nothing writes `state.camera.zoom`
     * from here, and nothing writes a feature's stored `style.fontSize` - the
     * student's own setting is theirs, and this only changes how large it is

     * it would be unreadable. So the text follows the zoom only within a band -
     * past either end it stops, and the drawing keeps scaling around it.
     *

     * It used to be 92 above and 46 below, which is not a neutral choice
     * but a claim: that twice as much ordinate is available above as below.
     * For a shear force or a bending moment diagram that is simply wrong,
     * because those are the quantities that change sign, and the half that
     * is drawn smaller is the half that holds the interesting answers. A
     * student comparing the tension and compression regions of an SFD was
     * reading them off an asymmetric scale.
     *
     * So there is one height, used both ways. The frame is as tall below
     * the axis as above it, the y-axis spans all of it, and neither figure
     * depends on what has been drawn in it.
     *
     * WHY IT IS TALL. The frame is the graph's coordinate system, and a
     * coordinate system with a stubby y-axis reads as a picture of a
     * diagram rather than as something to plot against. 110 either way
     * gives room for a full shear jump or a moment hump without the curve
     * having to be shrunk to fit, and leaves margin at the top and bottom
     * of the plot region - which is what the y-axis is there to span.

 * Everything else here draws what the document happens to contain. A
 * force's magnitude is not a separate thing on the sheet - it is a property
 * OF the force - so there was nothing for the setting to switch on, and
 * turning it on changed nothing.
 *
 * DERIVED, NOT STORED. This is called on every frame and produces the text
      * from the feature's own geometry, so it cannot go stale when the magnitude
      * is edited and cannot drift when the force moves. A stored copy would be a
      * second number free to disagree with the first.
      *
      * BUT THE PLACEMENT IS STORED, because the student can MOVE it.
      *
      * It used to be argued that the box carries no document id, so a click on
      * it resolves to the feature - "which is what clicking a force should
      * do". That is right for a click on the ARROW and wrong for a click on
      * the NUMBER: the arrow is the force, the number is a label the student
      * placed and has every reason to want somewhere else, because
      * `F = 100 N` printed across the arrowhead is unreadable.
      *
      * So the box is picked as the box, and moving it stores an OFFSET on the
      * feature - not the value. The number is still derived, so it cannot go
      * stale; only where it sits is remembered, which is exactly the part the
      * student chose and the part the application has no opinion about.
      *
      * An offset of null means "wherever it naturally falls", which is where
      * it sat before any of this and where it returns when the student moves
      * it back.
      *
      * CALLED FROM BOTH EXITS. Statics features take an early return once their
      * own symbol is drawn, so appending only at the end of the pass silently
      * skipped every force, load, moment, support and connection - which is the
      * entire set of features that has a magnitude.

                 * dragging vertices around. That is what keeps the

     * Distributed Load's arrows all come through here, so an arrowhead is
     * computed one way for all of them.
     *
     * WHY IT TAKES TWO POINTS AND NOT AN ANGLE
     * ----------------------------------------
     * The previous version of this took an `angleDegrees` and a
     * `length`, and reconstructed the tip as
     *
     *     y: anchor.y - Math.sin(radians) * length
     *
     * That leading minus is the bug. `anchor` is already a SCREEN point,
     * and screen y grows DOWNWARD, so subtracting the vertical component
     * sent every force drawn through this path to the wrong side of its
     * application point: a force pointing up was drawn pointing down.
     *
     * The caller at the time made it look right by handing in a negated
     * angle (`Math.atan2(-dy, dx)`), so the two sign errors cancelled and
     * the picture happened to be correct - which is exactly why it survived.
     * Two wrongs in one place is not a working arrangement: it cannot be
     * changed, reused for a new vector type, or reasoned about without
     * working out which of the two signs is wrong for a given quadrant.
     *
     * The fix is not to correct the sign but to remove the need for one.
     * A caller that already HAS both ends - which is every vector in this
     * module, since engineering geometry is stored as a tail and a head -
     * hands both over, and the arrowhead direction is measured from them:
     *
     *     angle = atan2(headScreen.y - tailScreen.y,
     *                   headScreen.x - tailScreen.x)
     *
     * ONE conversion, in ONE place: world to screen, at the boundary,
     * through `toScreen`. The engineering vector keeps its own signs, and
     * nothing downstream has to know that the sheet is drawn upside down
     * relative to the axes.
     *
     * The two points are the whole truth about a vector, so a magnitude of
     * zero is now visible as two coincident points rather than having to
     * be inferred from an angle of 0 and a length of 0.

     * function rather than by a per-type placement rule.
