 * ============================================================
 * THE CANVAS PALETTE: AUTHORED COLOUR -> DISPLAY COLOUR
 * ============================================================
 *
 * A feature's colour is part of the DOCUMENT. It is chosen by the student, it is
 * saved in the file, and it is exported and printed - so it must never be
 * rewritten because the interface's theme changed.
 *
 * But a drawing made on white paper is drawn in dark ink, and that ink is
 * invisible the moment the canvas turns charcoal. Something has to adapt, and
 * the only safe thing to adapt is the DISPLAY:
 *
 *     authored colour  --(this module)-->  display colour
 *
 * The authored colour is what is stored, saved, exported and shown in the
 * colour picker. The display colour exists only for the frame being painted. The
 * theme can therefore change as often as the student likes and the document never
 * moves - which is the whole point, and the reason a naive "recolour every
 * feature on theme change" would be wrong. That approach DRIFTS: each toggle
 * would transform the colour it produced last time, and a black line would walk
 * through a series of greys until it was no longer black at all.
 *
 * ============================================================
 * WHY THIS IS A MODULE AND NOT A LINE IN THE RENDERER
 * ============================================================
 *
 * Every canvas entity - geometry, dimensions, notes, forces, loads, supports,
 * analysis graphics - has to adapt, and the renderer draws all of them. If the
 * rule lived inside any one of their drawing functions the others would each need
 * their own copy, and they would disagree: this requirement explicitly forbids
 * "separate inversion logic in each individual drawing tool".
 *
 * So there is ONE function, `displayColourFor(colour, theme)`, and it is pure: it
 * reads no state and writes nothing. The renderer calls it at the moment it sets
 * an attribute. Nothing here touches the document.
 *
 * ============================================================
 * THE RULE, AND WHAT IT DELIBERATELY IS NOT
 * ============================================================
 *
 * IT IS NOT `filter: invert(1)`. That would also invert the canvas background,
 * the grid, the selection handles and the snap markers - the interface would
 * become unusable, and the requirement calls this out by name. Inverting a colour
 * VALUE, here, has none of those consequences: the background is a theme token
 * and is never passed through this function.
 *
 * IT IS NOT A BLANKET NUMERIC INVERSION EITHER. A pure inversion maps mid-greys
 * to mid-greys (a 50% grey inverts to itself, so it stays invisible on both
 * grounds - the requirement says so explicitly), and it turns colour families
 * inside out: red becomes cyan, which is a different colour with different
 * meaning. So the rule is:
 *
 *   NEUTRALS are re-pointed to the theme's counterpart. A dark neutral becomes
 *   the light theme's ink counterpart, so black-on-white becomes ice-on-charcoal.
 *   This preserves the AUTHOR'S INTENT - "I drew this in ordinary ink" - and it is
 *   the common case, because most drawings are monochrome.
 *
 *   CHROMATIC colours keep their identity. Hue and saturation are preserved and
 *   only the LIGHTNESS is adjusted, and only if the colour would not be legible on
 *   the active canvas. A red dimension stays red in both themes; it is lifted in
 *   dark mode so it can be read, and left alone entirely when it already can be.
 *
 * ============================================================
 * REVERSIBILITY
 * ============================================================
 *
 * Because the authored colour is never written, reversal is free: switching back
 * to the light theme passes the SAME authored colour through the light rule and
 * returns the original value exactly. There is no "previous colour" to restore and
 * so nothing to get wrong. `displayColourFor` is a pure function of (colour,
 * theme), which is what makes light -> dark -> light an identity.
 */

/*
 * THE CANVAS BACKGROUND OF EACH THEME, as the contrast arithmetic needs it.
 *
 * These are the values `--canvas-background` resolves to in `tokens.css`. They

 * asks. A test asserts the two agree, so the duplication cannot drift silently.
