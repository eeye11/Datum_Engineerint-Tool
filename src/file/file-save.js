/*
 * ========================================================
 * SAVING A DOCUMENT, AND SAVING A DRAWING AS AN IMAGE
 * ========================================================
 *
 * Save and Save As use the OPERATING SYSTEM's own save panel, the same
 * one a desktop application gets. Not a dialog built in the page, and
 * not window.prompt: the whole point of a file is where it ends up, and
 * choosing that is the operating system's job, not something the
 * application should be inventing a worse version of.
 *
 * ========================================================
 * ONE SAVE AS, THREE OUTPUTS
 * ========================================================
 *
 * Save As is the ONE place a student chooses the representation they
 * want, and the choice is made in the system panel rather than in a
 * second, application-owned dialog:
 *
 *     Datum project  the editable document
 *     PNG            a clean drawing snip
 *     JPG / JPEG     the same snip, encoded differently
 *
 * There is deliberately no separate Export workflow. "Export -> Image ->
 * PNG" asks the student to learn a second idea for the same act, and it
 * leaves two paths that produce a file - two places for the filename,
 * the extension and the cancellation handling to disagree. Save As
 * decides the format; this module writes it.
 *
 * ========================================================
 * TWO BROWSERS, TWO ROUTES
 * ========================================================
 *
 * Where the File System Access API exists, the panel returns a handle to
 * the file itself. That handle is kept, and a later Save writes straight
 * back to it - no panel, no filename, and no chance of quietly saving a
 * second copy somewhere else. This is the behaviour that makes Save
 * genuinely different from Save As.
 *
 * Where it does not - Safari and Firefox today - a download is the only
 * thing a web page can do with a file, so that is what happens, and the
 * browser's own download flow chooses the destination. The difference is
 * stated plainly rather than hidden: without a handle there is nothing
 * to remember a handle to, so Save re-offers the name every time.
 *
 * ========================================================
 * WHAT THIS MODULE DOES NOT DO
 * ========================================================
 *
 * It does not RENDER. An image is produced by the drawing renderer,
 * which is handed to this module as a callback. Keeping the render out
 * of here is what stops this file from growing a second, private
 * understanding of how a drawing looks - the exported PNG is the same
 * drawing the canvas shows, produced by the same code.
 *
 * It also never edits the document. Saving is not a document change, so
 * nothing here touches the model, and the caller adds no history entry.

 * `File` is a read-only snapshot with no way to write to where it came from. So

 * Save As every time: the user was asked to choose a filename again for a file
 * they had just chosen.
 *
 * `showOpenFilePicker` gives a HANDLE, which can be written back to. Where the
