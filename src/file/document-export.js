 * It was tempting to let Fit compute its own zoom, since the
 * editor has a canvas and an export has an image and they look
 * like different jobs. They are not: all four are the same
 * question - given a world-space rectangle and a pixel viewport,
 * what camera shows that rectangle? The answer does not depend on
 * who asked, and having each of them work it out separately is how
 * a Fit and an export end up framing the same drawing differently
 * while both look correct in isolation.
 *
 * So the two steps are named and separated here:
 *
 *   getRenderableBounds(target)  what is actually visible
 *   fitBoundsIntoViewport(...)    what camera shows it
 *
 * and the callers supply the bounds from whichever source of truth
 * they have. Fit passes the editor's rendered bounds, the export
 * passes the same ones for the same objects. The second step

 * which is the fault the specification calls out: a 5mm margin
 * around a 200mm beam is a comfortable 2.5%, while the same 5mm
 * around a 2000mm truss is invisible, and around a 20mm detail it
 * swallows the drawing. A margin that is always the same share of
 * the canvas looks the same whatever is being fitted, and it
 * automatically shrinks and grows with zoom.
 *
 * It is less than one so the drawing is inset rather than touching
