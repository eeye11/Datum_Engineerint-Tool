/*
 * ========================================================
 * DRAW ORDER
 * ========================================================
 *
 * Which feature is drawn ON TOP of which.
 *
 * THE ORDER IS THE ARRAY. The renderer walks `state.objects` in order and
 * appends each feature's SVG as it goes, so a feature later in the array is
 * drawn over one earlier in it. Draw order is therefore not a separate property
 * to keep in step with anything - it is the position in the one list the whole
 * application already uses. That is deliberate: a second `zIndex` field would be
 * a second source of truth for the same fact, and the two would eventually
 * disagree.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NOT A SELECTION CONCERN
 * -----------------------------------
 * Changing the order changes ONLY what covers what. It must never change what
 * can be picked, snapped to, dimensioned or found by a selection rectangle. The
 * hit test walks the array BACKWARDS (topmost first) so that overlapping
 * features are picked in the order they look, but a feature sent to the back is
 * still hit-tested - just last - and a feature drawn under another is still
 * reachable wherever the one on top is not actually under the cursor. Draw order
 * is a visual statement, not an access-control list.
 *
 * WHY IT IS A DOCUMENT EDIT
 * -------------------------
 * The order is part of the drawing: it is saved, it survives a reopen, and it
 * is something the user chose. So every command here is one committed change -
 * one history entry, one dirty mark, one render - exactly like moving a feature.
