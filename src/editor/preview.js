 * drive - an analysis axis, a moment's radius, an annotation's position, a
 * dimension's placement - and each of them returns early.
 *
 * Every one of those returns used to skip the status text. The snap and
 * inference half of that text is appended by a separate call, so on those
 * tools the LAST snap the cursor happened to make stayed printed for as long
 * as the tool was active - long after the cursor had left whatever it was
 * aligned with. It reads as a live report because it is one, only an old
 * one: the student drags somewhere unaligned and cannot tell whether the
 * snap still holds or the label is simply stale.
 *
 * One function, called from every branch, so a branch added later cannot
 * forget. It is deliberately thin: the wording rules live in
 * `constructionFeedbackMessage`, and this only decides THAT it is called.

     * Why the application point is FIXED once chosen: it is the point
     * the force acts, and it is the thing the whole symbol is
     * describing. Letting the cursor drag it would mean a moment
     * applied at a load quietly slid somewhere else while the radius
     * was being adjusted, which is precisely the "tidier looking"
     * relocation the specification forbids.

     * point, so moving the pointer out grows the arc and moving it
     * back in shrinks it - and the arc is drawn through the shared
     * rotational renderer, so the preview is the same curve the
