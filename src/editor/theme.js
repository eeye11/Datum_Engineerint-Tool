/*
 * ============================================================
 * THE APPLICATION THEME
 * ============================================================
 *
 * One preference, three values, and one place that applies it:
 *
 *     "system"  follow the operating system
 *     "light"   the light palette, whatever the OS prefers
 *     "dark"    the dark palette, whatever the OS prefers
 *
 * THE ATTRIBUTE IS THE STATE, and the palette is CSS.
 *
 * Applying a theme writes `data-theme` on `<html>` and nothing else. Every
 * colour in the interface is a token (see `tokens.css`), so re-pointing the
 * tokens re-themes the whole application at once - menus, panels, dialogs,
 * inputs, hover and focus states alike. There is deliberately no per-component
 * colour assignment, because a component that chooses its own colour is a
 * component that can be forgotten.
 *
 * `system` REMOVES the attribute rather than setting it to a third value. With
 * no attribute, the `prefers-color-scheme` block in the stylesheet supplies the
 * dark palette, so the correct theme is in place BEFORE any script runs - there
 * is no flash of the wrong palette on load, and no listener is needed to react
 * to the OS changing.
 *
 * WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT TOUCH
 * -----------------------------------
 * The drawing. A feature's stroke, a force's colour, a dimension's text and the
 * canvas background all belong to the DOCUMENT - they are the student's work,
 * they are saved in the file, and they are exported and printed. Re-theming the
 * interface must never recolour them, so nothing here reaches the drawing state.
 * A dark interface over a light sheet is a normal, supported combination.
 *
 * WHERE IT IS STORED
 * ------------------
 * `localStorage`, beside the other interface preferences - NOT in the document.
 * A theme is how somebody likes to work, not a property of the drawing, so
 * opening a file someone else made must not change it, and two people opening
 * the same file keep their own.

/*
 * THE DEFAULT DRAWING LINE COLOUR, PER THEME.
 *
 * This is the colour a NEWLY drawn feature gets when the student has not chosen
 * one. It is NOT the interface accent (`--datum-green`): the accent marks which
 * tools are ACTIVE, and a line painted in it would claim the drawing was the
 * interface's colour. It is a dark teal-charcoal on the light sheet and an
 * ice-white on the dark one, so a default line is always clearly visible against
 * the paper it is drawn on.
 *
 * IT IS READ FROM THE RESOLVED THEME, not written into the document. Existing
 * features keep the stroke they were drawn with: changing the theme must never
 * recolour work the student made - that is the one rule this module exists to
 * keep (see the header). Only a NEW feature, created after the theme changed,
 * picks up the new value.
