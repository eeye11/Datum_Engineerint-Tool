 * inspector field, not an engineering one: it showed the student a value the
 * model had already told them - the name at the top of this very panel - in a
 * different vocabulary, and for a feature with no friendly label the fallback
 * was the internal type string itself. A student reading "analysis-diagram"
 * learns nothing about the analysis diagram they made, and it is precisely
 * the kind of internal term that has no business being displayed.
 *
 * So the type now appears once, as the title, in the words the student uses.
 * The editable name stays, because what a student calls a feature is theirs to
 * choose and is not the same question as what kind of thing it is.

     *   - NO EMPTY SECTIONS. A heading is produced together with the fields
     *     that justify it, or not at all.
     *
     * It also joins a number and its unit in one place (so no field can read
     * "100 NN"), escapes every string that reaches the markup, and drops
     * trailing zeros consistently, so two panels never disagree about how a
     * value is written.
