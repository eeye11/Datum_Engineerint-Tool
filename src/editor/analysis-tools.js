/*
 * ========================================================
 * RESULTANT AND FORCE COMPONENTS: THE INPUT-SELECTION STATE
 * ========================================================
 *
 * These two are CHILD analysis features. A Resultant reads one or more Force
 * features and a Force Components pair reads exactly one, and everything either
 * of them shows is DERIVED from those forces. So the one thing the student must
 * be able to say, unambiguously, is WHICH force(s) the child reads.
 *
 * That question used to be answered for them - the tools read whatever was in
 * the selection at the instant the button was pressed. A force the student had
 * just drawn was still selected, so pressing Resultant produced a Resultant of
 * it without the student ever naming it, and a stray click during creation
 * could take an existing Resultant's parent as the input by proximity.
 *
 * The workflow here makes the input EXPLICIT:
 *
 *     activate the tool        -> "Select force" / "Select force(s)"
 *     click a Force            -> it is added as an input (never inferred)
 *     click a Resultant        -> nothing: not a Force, so not an input
 *     click empty space        -> nothing
 *     Enter                    -> the child is created from the inputs
 *
 * NOTHING IS GUESSED. A click on a child never stands in for its parent, the
 * nearest force is never chosen, and the previously selected force is never
 * reused. The Selected force(s) are shown by the ordinary selection highlight,
 * which is already the application's way of saying "this one is picked".
