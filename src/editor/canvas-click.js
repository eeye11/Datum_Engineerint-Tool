     *
     * This is the one rule that makes Select mean the same thing

     * whichever tool is currently active.
     *
     * Before this, selecting an existing object was only possible
     * with the Select tool active. A student with Beam selected who
     * clicked an existing Point Force did not select the force - the
     * Beam tool consumed the click and started a new beam through
     * it. Selecting therefore became a mode the student had to be
     * IN, and switching to it and back for every edit was pure
     * friction.
     *
     * WHERE IT SITS IN THE ORDER, AND WHY
     * -----------------------------------
     * Placement is the design; it is a priority order and not a set
     * of tool exceptions:
     *
     *   1. an active editing interaction  - Modify, handled above
     *   2. the tool's own meaning for a click on existing geometry -
     *      construction, dimensions, annotations
     *   3. a CONSTRUCTION that is mid-flight and needs this click as
     *      one of ITS points
     *   4. an existing object under the pointer
     *   5. the tool's own handling of empty space
     *
     * Step 2 is why this block sits BELOW the dimension and annotation
     * tools rather than above them, and getting that wrong is the
     * mistake this ordering exists to prevent.
     *
     * A dimension and an annotation are not placed on empty canvas.
     * They are MEASURED and LABELLED, and the whole point of them is
     * that they attach to something already on the sheet: clicking a
     * beam with the Dimension tool means "measure that beam", and
     * clicking a force with the Annotation tool means "write on that
     * force". Intercepting those clicks to select the beam instead
     * would quietly remove the tools' entire reason for being - the
     * student could not dimension anything without switching to Select
     * first, which is the very problem this change removes,
     * reintroduced one level down.
     *
     * Steps 3 and 4 are the universal part. A running construction is
     * exempt - a half-built Beam is waiting for its second point, and
     * taking the click for a selection would strand it - and the
     * exemption is asked of the interaction state rather than of a
     * list of tools, so no tool can be forgotten.
     *
     * Step 4 uses the same hit test Select uses, which already knows
     * about dimensions, annotations, analysis objects and every
     * statics symbol. So no tool needs to know how to be selectable
     * and no category needs its own rule: a tool that was never
     * thought about when this was written still gets it.

     * THE ANALYSIS AXIS PLACEMENT, BEFORE ANY SELECTION.
     *
     * The comment below used to describe this branch as sitting ahead of
     * the construction tools and the selection test, and it was written
     * with the reasoning in full: a click on an existing feature during a
     * placement is a PLACEMENT click, not a selection, because the
     * student is being asked where the diagram goes and the only thing
     * that answers that is where the pointer is.
     *
     * The code said the opposite. The selection test ran first, so a click
     * on the beam was taken as a selection and returned before this branch
     * was ever reached - the diagram stayed unplaced and the tool stayed
     * armed, which is the one outcome that comment calls a half-finished
     * sheet.
     *
     * So the order is what the comment always claimed. A running analysis
     * placement owns the pointer, and that is decided by the interaction
     * phase rather than by what happens to be under it.

     * This used to open a dimension-specific dialog whose first question was
     * the sheet's WORLD SCALE, alongside precision and text settings. Two
     * things were wrong with that, and both are fixed by routing here.
     *
     * FIRST, THE SCALE QUESTION. A scale is a property of the DRAWING, not of
     * the dimension the student just double-clicked, and it was being asked
     * every time somebody wanted to change a number. It is now asked where a
     * drawing setting belongs - nowhere in this path.
     *
     * SECOND, THERE WERE TWO WAYS TO EDIT A DIMENSION. The canvas double-click
     * and the picked-row click both came to this function, and it is the one
     * place both reach - so putting the shared popup HERE means neither can
     * present a different box from the other, and a third caller added later
     * inherits the same behaviour.
     *
     * `openDimensionValuePrompt` is kept as its own function so this stays a
     * one-line delegate: a reader looking for "what opens when a dimension is
     * edited" finds the answer in the name, and does not have to know which
     * dialog implementation happens to back it.

/*
 * OPEN THE NOTE EDITOR FOR A WRITTEN ANNOTATION.
 *
 * A Note is the student's own words, so double-clicking it (or double-
 * clicking its entry in the Features tree) opens the note editor here,
 * the same "open this thing" gesture the dimension uses.
 *
 * A GENERATED annotation is refused one: its text is a reading of the
 * feature it describes and the next redraw would overwrite anything
 * typed, so there is deliberately no path from here to the editor for
 * one. The guard is the model's own `isGenerated`, so a new generated
 * kind is refused automatically rather than by remembering to list it.
