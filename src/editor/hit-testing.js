                     * does, so they used to fall through to the empty list and
                     * contribute NOTHING to the drawing's extent. That made Fit
                     * quietly wrong: a dimension is placed deliberately OUTSIDE
                     * the geometry it measures, and an annotation is placed
                     * wherever the student put it, so both are often the
                     * outermost things on the sheet.
                     *
                     * The result was a Fit that framed the geometry and left the
                     * dimension hanging off the edge of the canvas - clipped,
                     * and invisible, which is the one thing a Fit must never do
                     * to content that is really there.
                     *
                     * So both are placed. A dimension contributes its own
                     * presentation position - the offset it was dragged to, NOT
                     * the geometry it measures, because dragging a dimension
                     * must not move the source feature and the extent must
                     * follow the presentation, not the measurement. An
                     * annotation contributes its placement point, together with
                     * the height of its text, because text sits ABOVE the point
                     * it is anchored to and a tall label would otherwise be
                     * half off the top of a fitted view.
                     *
                     * This is the same shared extent function the Fit and the
                     * Drawing References use, so the two cannot disagree about
                     * how big the drawing is.
