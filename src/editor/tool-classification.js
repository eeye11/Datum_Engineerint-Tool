/*
 * ========================================================
 * WHAT KIND OF CLICK A TOOL EXPECTS
 * ========================================================
 *
 * A creation tool's click is not one thing. Two broad shapes exist, and the
 * difference decides what a single click on existing geometry MEANS:
 *
 *   POINT-STYLE
 *     The tool's input is a single point. A click anywhere - on empty space or
 *     on a feature - is the answer it was waiting for. It places its feature at
 *     the point and stays armed for the next one. A Point, a Particle, a
 *     Reference Point and a single-click placement support are all this shape,
 *     and none of them should be knocked out of the tool by a click.
 *
 *   PATH-STYLE
 *     The tool's feature needs a line, a path, a region or a sequence. A plain
 *     click is NOT enough to make one - the student must move the pointer and
 *     click again, or press and drag. So a bare click with such a tool armed is
 *     not "the first point of a shape", it is the student finishing with the
 *     tool: it EXITS to Select, selecting whatever was under the cursor.
 *
 * THE POINT OF NAMING BOTH, HERE, ONCE
 * ------------------------------------
 * The distinction used to live implicitly in the construction pipeline, and the
 * consequence was that a student who had just drawn a Line and then clicked on
 * empty space stayed trapped in the Line tool, having to find the Select button
 * to escape. So the classification is stated explicitly and read by the click
 * router, rather than inferred case by case from what each tool happens to do.
 *
 * WHY THE PATH SET IS NOT WRITTEN OUT HERE
 * ----------------------------------------
 * "Which tools can make their feature from ONE press-drag-release" is already
 * answered, precisely, by `isDragCreationTool` in the creation layer - it is the
 * same fact the drag pipeline itself keys on. A second hand-written list here
 * would be a second answer, free to disagree with the first, so the question is
 * asked of that one function rather than restated.
 */

import { isDragCreationTool } from "./creation-drag.js";

/*
 * The tools whose interaction is a SINGLE POINT.
 *
 * Everything else that is a creation tool is path-style by default, so a new
 * tool gets the exit-to-Select behaviour unless it is deliberately listed here.
 * That direction of default is the safe one: a point tool wrongly treated as
 * path-style merely exits when the student clicks, while a path tool wrongly
 * treated as point-style would place a degenerate feature on a stray click.

/*
 * ========================================================
 * SHOULD A BARE CLICK EXIT THE ACTIVE TOOL?
 * ========================================================
 *
 * Yes for a tool whose WHOLE feature is one press-drag-release and which has no
 * step after it: a bare click cannot be that feature, so it means "I am
 * finished with this tool". No for everything else:
 *
 *   - a POINT tool places its feature on that click (its intended behaviour);
 *   - Select is already Select;
 *   - a Modify or View session owns its own clicks;
 *   - a tool with an EXPLICIT REQUIRED INPUT (a dimension collecting
 *     references, a Resultant waiting to be told which force, a label or a
 *     leader attachment) must keep receiving the click - its own state machine
 *     decides what the click means, and pulling it into Select would break the
 *     input workflow the student is halfway through;
 *   - a MULTI-STEP tool (a triangle, a polygon, an arc, a polyline, a truss,
 *     a distributed load) needs several clicks to make anything, so a click is
 *     a REAL STEP of its workflow and must not exit it.
 *
 * WHY `isDragCreationTool` IS NOT ENOUGH ON ITS OWN
 * -------------------------------------------------
 * That predicate answers "can a press-drag-release make this feature's FIRST
 * span" - which is true of a triangle and an arc as well as a line, because
 * their first edge comes from the drag. But a triangle is not finished after
 * that edge, so a bare click is not "done" for it. The one-gesture set is
 * therefore NARROWED here by the tools that have steps after the first, rather
 * than used directly.
