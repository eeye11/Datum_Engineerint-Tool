/*
 * THE DIMENSION TOOLS
 *
 * Dimension and Smart Dimension are ONE tool with two different
 * answers to a single question: what is being measured?
 *
 * Smart Dimension reads the selection and decides - a circle becomes a
 * diameter because that is what a circle's size is normally quoted as.
 * Dimension asks instead, cycling through the measurements the selected
 * geometry actually supports, so a student who wants a beam quoted
 * vertically rather than horizontally gets that without the program
 * having to guess what they meant.
 *
 * Neither tool decides the MEASUREMENT TYPE in a way that bypasses the
 * feature's own registration. Both ask measurement-core what the
 * selection can be measured as, which is why a Beam offers a span and
 * a Circle offers a diameter, and why adding a new feature type later
 * needs no change here at all.
 *
 * The lifecycle is deliberately short, and every part of it is
 * temporary:
 *
 *   1. click a feature     -> armed, with the measurements it supports
 *   2. press D / Tab       -> move to the next measurement
 *   3. move the cursor     -> live preview at the cursor
 *   4. click               -> the dimension is committed
 *   Escape                 -> all of it discarded, nothing saved
 *
 * Nothing is written to the drawing until step 4, which is what makes
 * Escape safe: there is no partial dimension to clean up.
 */

/*
 * THE ANNOTATION TOOL
 *
 * Creates the annotation the student actually wants, which depends on
 * what they click:
 *
 *   - a FEATURE gives an ASSOCIATIVE label that reads its own values and
 *     goes on reading them, so a force labelled once keeps up with the
 *     force however it is later edited (spec 32);
 *   - EMPTY SPACE gives a FREE-TEXT note, which belongs to nothing and
 *     is the student's own writing (spec 34).
 *
 * The kinds offered for a feature are asked of the annotation model,
 * which answers by what that feature can actually be labelled as -
 * never from a list written here - so a new feature type is labelled
 * correctly without this file knowing it exists.
 *
 * The lifecycle matches the Dimension tool's exactly: click to arm, move
 * to position with a live preview, click to commit, Escape to abandon.
 * Nothing is written to the drawing until that last click, which is what
 * makes Escape safe - there is no partial annotation to clean up.
