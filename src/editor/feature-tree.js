/*
 * ========================================================
 * WHAT KIND OF FEATURE IS THIS?
 * ========================================================
 *
 * The ONE answer to "which group does this feature belong in", used by
 * the Feature Tree and by the Features panel so the two cannot disagree.
 *
 * IT IS ASKED OF THE FEATURE, NOT INFERRED FROM ITS TYPE ALONE.
 *
 * Geometry and Statics SHARE implementations - one Line class, one Arc
 * function, one renderer - and what makes a Line a "Reference Line" is the
 * statics discipline recorded on the object, not anything about its
 * geometry. A function that classified by type would have to know every
 * statics type by name, and a new statics feature would be filed as plain
 * geometry the day it was added, which is exactly how the AFD/SFD/BMD
 * diagrams ended up among the geometry in the first place: their factory
 * was the one statics factory that never recorded the discipline, so every
 * reader of that field answered "geometry" and the tree obeyed.
 *
 * ========================================================
 * ONE STATICS GROUP. THERE IS NO "ANALYSIS" GROUP.
 * ========================================================
 *
 * An earlier version of this gave diagrams, resultants and components a
 * group of their own, on the reasoning that they are READINGS taken off
 * something else rather than marks on the sheet. The distinction is real.
 * It is also the wrong place to express it.
 *
 * The tree's job is to say what each feature depends on, and every one of
 * these depends on a BODY: a diagram is read off a member, a resultant off
 * the forces it sums, a components pair off the force it decomposes. So
 * they already appear NESTED UNDER that body. A second grouping on top of
 * that answered a question nobody asked while making the real one harder
 * to answer - a student looking for their SFD found a list of bodies and
 * had to know which one it was filed under before they could look inside.
 *
 * It is also a category a student cannot act on. You cannot drag a diagram
 * into "Analysis", and it is not a thing anybody placed. A group that
 * exists only to re-sort is a second classification competing with the
 * parent relationship, and the two disagree the moment a diagram's source
 * body changes - at which point the diagram belongs under a different body
 * but is still filed in the group it was first put in.
 *
 * So: one Statics group, and the parent relationship does the rest. A
 * diagram whose body is not on the sheet is still a Statics row - it has a
 * body, the sheet simply does not have it.

/*
 * ============================================================
 * WHERE A FEATURE IS FILED IN THE TREE
 * ============================================================
 *
 * ONE answer, asked by both the root-row test and the child lookup, so a
 * feature cannot appear as a root row in one pass and as somebody's child
 * in another.
 *
 * `parentId` ALONE WAS NOT ENOUGH, AND THAT IS THE FAULT THIS FIXES.
 *
 * Force Components reads a force - that relationship is recorded in
 * `engineering.sourceFeatureIds` - and it was being filed under the force's
 * BODY, because its `parentId` was copied from the force's. So it appeared as
 * a loose sibling of the force rather than beneath it, and a student looking
 * for the decomposition of a force had to scan the whole branch to find it.
 * The same was true of a Resultant.
 *
 * It could not simply be given the force as its `parentId`, because
 * `parentId` means something specific everywhere else: it names the BODY a
 * feature is drawn on. The renderer looks it up to find the member a preview
 * belongs to, the Features panel prints it as "Relative to", and the parent
 * body's attached-feature counts filter on it. Overloading it with a force
 * would have moved the decomposition under the right row in the tree and
 * quietly broken the attachment it was still supposed to have - one correct
 * surface and three broken ones.
 *
 * SO A TREE PARENT IS A SEPARATE QUESTION FROM AN ATTACHMENT, and this is
 * the answer to it. A feature is filed under its own body when it has one,
 * and under the feature it READS when it does not. That matches what the
 * student is actually looking at: a force's components belong with the force,
 * a diagram belongs with its member, and neither relationship is invented
 * here - both are already recorded on the objects.
 *
 * The Resultant takes its FIRST source for the same reason the derivation
 * anchors it there: the sum is drawn from one force's application point, and
 * that is the one whose motion it follows.
