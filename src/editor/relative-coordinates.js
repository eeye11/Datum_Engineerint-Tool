 * A CHILD'S POSITION ALONG ITS PARENT
 * ========================================================
 *
 * A child of a body - a force, a load, a moment, a support - is positioned
 * by a DISTANCE ALONG that body, and that is the whole of it. Everything
 * else about where it sits is derived: its height above or below the
 * centreline comes from the direction the force acts, its orientation
 * comes from the body's own normal.
 *
 * IT USED TO SHOW TWO NUMBERS - Offset X and Offset Y - and both were ways
 * to make the feature wrong.
 *
 * They are the child's world position expressed relative to the parent's
 * start: two numbers describing one fact, of which the second is a
 * consequence of the first and of the direction. A student who set both
 * had to keep them consistent with a direction shown elsewhere in the same
 * panel, and nothing checked it - so a load with a positive Offset Y and a
 * downward direction is a field that can be filled in and produces a load
 * sitting on the wrong side of the beam.
 *
 * THE STATION IS PROJECTED, NOT READ OFF `x`.
 *
 * A distance along a member is measured along its axis. Reading
 * `anchor.x` only works for a horizontal member: on a vertical or rotated
 * one every station reads as zero, which makes the field look like a
 * control that does nothing. Projecting onto the parent's own direction
 * means the number means the same thing on any beam.

 * ========================================================
 *
 * For a child that is a REGION - the two distributed loads - the rows are
 * the region's two ends. For one that is a POINT - a force, a moment, a
 * support - it is the single station along the body.
 *
 * For a load this replaces eight fields with two. It used to offer
 * Start X, Start Y, End X and End Y, plus Offset X and Offset Y from this
 * function: six numbers for the two facts a load actually has - the region
 * it covers and the direction it pushes - with the height of each end
 * stored independently of both.
 *
 * THAT IS WHAT MADE A LOAD FLIPPY. The height of the load's outline was
 * a stored coordinate rather than something derived from the body and the
 * direction, so reversing the direction changed the arrows without moving
 * the outline, and the outline was then on the wrong side of the member
 * with no field anywhere that said so. The load is now positioned by its
 * two stations and its direction alone; the height follows.
 *
 * THE PARENT IS NAMED, AS A ROW.
 *
 * It was a single line of prose - "Relative to: Beam 3" - which is two
 * pieces of information in one unbreakable string. A feature named after
 * something a student typed ("Simply supported beam 3m") produced a line
 * the panel was too narrow to show, and the relation - the one thing this
 * row exists to say - was the part that disappeared. As a row, the name
 * gets its own wrapping column and can break across lines instead of
 * across the edge of the panel.
