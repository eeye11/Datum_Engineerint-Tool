 * ========================================================
 * THE STATUS TEXT FOR A LIVE CONSTRUCTION
 * ========================================================
 *
 * The tool's own instruction, with the current snap APPENDED - never
 * substituted for it.
 *
 * A snap that is working but not announced reads as a snap that is not
 * working: the geometry jumps into line and nothing says why. So every
 * construction that can be pulled square reports the alignment it has
 * taken, from the same resolution the preview was drawn from, and the
 * guide line the renderer shows and this message describe the same
 * condition.
 *
 * WHY IT IS APPENDED AND NOT REPLACED
 * ----------------------------------
 * This used to return the snap label ALONE. That is the wrong shape, and
 * it is wrong in a way that shows up on every tool at once: "Specify
 * second point" became "Horizontal", and the student was left with a
 * statement about geometry and no idea what the tool was asking them to
 * do. On a tool whose instruction was the only thing carrying the next
 * step - place a support along this beam, choose the pivot - losing it
 * made the tool unusable mid-construction.
 *
 * The snap label is a REPORT and the instruction is a QUESTION. The
 * student needs the answer to "what am I being asked to do?" first, and
 * the answer to "what just happened?" second - which is the order they
 * appear in, and the reason for the separator.
 *
 * The instruction always comes from `fallback`, so a tool whose
 * instruction changes as the construction progresses still shows the
 * current one rather than the one it had when the tool was armed.
 *
 * THE SNAP HALF IS WHAT MAKES THIS CHEAP TO GET RIGHT. Only the appended
 * part may be empty; the base may not. That is the whole invariant, and it
 * is why the snap label is filtered rather than the instruction.
