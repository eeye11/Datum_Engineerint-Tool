 * ========================================================
 * CREATION-TIME DIMENSIONING
 * ========================================================
 *
 * Every tool that makes something with a physical size ends the
 * same way: the geometry is built, its size is established, and
 * the feature is committed as ONE undoable action. This pair of
 * helpers is that ending, so a Beam and a Rectangle run the same
 * code and cannot drift into committing differently.
 *
 * `beginCreationDimensioning` asks the questions the feature's
 * shape needs, through the shared framework and the shared
 * popup, and calls back only with answers that were confirmed.
 * `commitCreatedFeature` is the commit itself - the snapshot,
 * the add, the history entry and the selection - which is what
 * the creation paths already did inline, now in one place.
 *
 * WHY THE FEATURE IS NOT ADDED FIRST
 * ----------------------------------
 * The document is untouched while the popup is open. If the
 * student cancels, there is nothing to remove, nothing to undo
 * and - crucially - no scale change: the FIRST dimension is what
 * calibrates the document, and a cancelled first dimension must
 * leave the document exactly as uncalibrated as it was. Adding
 * the feature first and removing it on cancel would make that
 * guarantee depend on the removal being perfect.
 */
/*
 * Draw the feature being sized, at the size currently typed.
 *
 * The object is NOT in the document yet - adding it would mean a
 * cancelled popup had committed something, and the first dimension is
 * what calibrates the sheet, so a cancelled first dimension has to
 * leave the sheet exactly as it found it. The preview is therefore
 * drawn from a COPY, through the very same setter the answer is
 * applied with, so the drawing the student is looking at is the
 * geometry that will be committed rather than an approximation of it.
 *
 * The copy is what makes it safe to resize repeatedly: every keystroke
 * writes a fresh copy from the geometry as it was drawn, so the
 * preview cannot drift away from the member the student actually drew
 * by accumulating its own edits.

     *
     * On an UNCALIBRATED sheet there is no scale to convert through -
     * and that is not a gap to work around, it is what calibration
     * MEANS. The first length defines the scale by declaring that
     * the geometry already drawn is that long, so the member's model
     * geometry is deliberately left exactly as drawn and it is the
     * interpretation that changes. Converting the number here would
     * have shown the member shrinking to half a world unit, and then
     * committed it at its original length: a preview that disagreed
     * with the answer.
