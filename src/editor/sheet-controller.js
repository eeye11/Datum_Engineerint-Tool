 * ========================================================
 * THE SHEET COLLECTION, IN THE DOCUMENT HISTORY
 * ========================================================
 *
 * The editor is the LIVE COPY of the active sheet and the collection sits
 * beside it, so the history cannot reach the collection on its own. These
 * three functions are how it does.
 *
 * Without them, Undo restored the objects on screen and nothing else:
 * adding a sheet, renaming one, reordering them and deleting one were all
 * invisible to Undo, and deleting a sheet took its features with it
 * permanently - which is the worst version of that bug, because the
 * features were not recoverable from anywhere.
 *
 * `capture` is taken BEFORE a sheet operation and `restore` is reached
 * through the same commit every drawing edit uses, so a sheet change is
 * ONE history entry like any other - not a special case, and not a second
 * stack.
 *
 * THE SHEET MODULE'S OWN SERIALISER IS USED FOR BOTH DIRECTIONS.
 *
 * `serializeCollection` already deep-copies every sheet and keeps the
 * active id, and `createCollection` already accepts that shape and
 * normalises whatever it is given. Re-implementing either here would be a
 * second opinion about what a sheet is - and the first attempt at this
 * called three functions that do not exist, which threw inside
 * `snapshotDrawing` and therefore broke EVERY edit in the application,
 * because a snapshot is taken on the click that places every feature.
