/*
 * ========================================================
 * CREATING A FEATURE BY PRESS, HOLD, DRAG AND RELEASE
 * ========================================================
 *
 * A construction tool used to take its points one CLICK at a time:
 *
 *     click first point
 *       -> move
 *       -> click second point
 *       -> committed
 *
 * That is two deliberate presses for one gesture. The student has
 * already said where the feature begins when they press the button, and
 * they have already said where it ends when they let go, so the second
 * press carries no information the release does not.
 *
 * So an applicable tool now takes its two cursor-defined points from
 * ONE press:
 *
 *     mousedown at the first point
 *       -> hold, drag: the preview follows the cursor continuously
 *       -> mouseup: the feature is committed at the released point
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THIS WRAPS THE EXISTING PIPELINE; IT DOES NOT REIMPLEMENT IT
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * The whole point of this module is that it adds a LIFETIME and nothing
 * else. Everything that already worked - the snapping, the inference, the
 * live preview, the geometry each tool builds, the size popup, the single
 * undo entry - is reached through exactly the same entry point the click
 * used, `beginOrCompleteGeometry`:
 *
 *     pointerdown  ->  begin    (the phase that waited for a first click)
 *     pointermove  ->  (the existing mousemove already redraws the preview)
 *     pointerup    ->  complete (the phase that waited for a second click)
 *
 * So a Line is still built by the Line factory, a Circle by the Circle
 * factory, and a snapped point is still the resolver's own answer on the
 * frame of the release. No geometry, no data model and no snapping rule
 * is touched here.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHICH TOOLS, AND WHY NOT ALL OF THEM
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * A tool takes part only when its feature is genuinely defined by the
 * first point and the point under the cursor. That is true of a Line, a
 * Rectangle, a Circle, a Triangle's second corner, the two-point half of
 * a Polygon and an Arc, a Point Force, and every Statics span - a Beam,
 * a Cable, a Shaft, a Connection, a Reference Line.
 *
 * It is NOT true of the tools that take a FLOW of points - a polyline,
 * a truss, a varying load - where each point is a separate decision and
 * a release has no single meaning. Those keep their click workflow.
 *
 * Nor is it true of the single-click placement tools - a support, a
 * moment, a point, a coordinate system - which have no second point to
 * take from a release at all.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE TRAILING CLICK IS SWALLOWED
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * A pointer interaction in a browser also fires a `click` on release.
 * Left alone it would arrive at `handleCanvasClick` and be read as a
 * second point - starting a fresh construction at the released position,
 * which is the "click, move, click" behaviour this replaces, still
 * running underneath the drag. So a drag that began and ended on the
 * canvas marks the click as consumed, and the click handler honours that
 * mark exactly once.
