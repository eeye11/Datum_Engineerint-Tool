 * Two operations that are easy to confuse and worth keeping apart:
 *
 *   FIT WHOLE PAGE   "Show me the entire current drawing."
 *   FIT SELECTED     "Zoom in on exactly what I selected."
 *
 * They share one piece of mathematics. The bounds are gathered per
 * object, and the camera is then calculated by the shared engine in
 * the export module, so Fit and an exported drawing of the same
 * content are framed identically. What differs is only WHICH objects
 * contribute bounds - and that is the entire difference between the
 * two commands, which is why they are two thin functions over one
 * shared core rather than two implementations.

 * Whether a feature is something Fit should show.

 * Fit is a VIEW operation, so it must only ever show what is
 * actually on the sheet. A hidden feature is not on the sheet, and a
 * temporary construction preview is not a document object at all.
 *
 * The grid is excluded for the same reason, and it is worth spelling
 * out because the grid is the one thing that genuinely has no
 * bounds: it is drawn across the whole viewport, so measuring it
 * would make Fit zoom out to infinity looking for the edge of
 * something that has no edge. Fit must answer "how big is the
