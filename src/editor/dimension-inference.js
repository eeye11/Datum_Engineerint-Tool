 * ========================================================
 * SMART DIMENSION: WHAT THE STUDENT JUST CLICKED
 * ========================================================
 *
 * A dimension reference is not merely "a feature". The tool has to tell
 * apart four kinds of click, because each leads to a different
 * measurement:
 *
 *   a SNAP POINT      an endpoint, midpoint, centre, quadrant,
 *                     intersection or point-on-entity - one exact model
 *                     point, named by the snap system
 *   a LINE            a straight body or segment, dimensioned by its
 *                     full length, or measured against another line
 *                     for an angle
 *   a CIRCLE / ARC    dimensioned by its own diameter or radius
 *   a BODY            anything else that exposes measurements
 *
 * The reference returned here is deliberately PERSISTENT: it names the
 * feature and the sub-element (an anchor name, or the feature's own
 * span), never a frozen coordinate. That is what lets the dimension
 * follow the geometry when it moves.
 *
 * A snap resolved to a real anchor wins over the feature under the
 * cursor: `endpoint to midpoint` is a different dimension from
 * `endpoint to endpoint`, and only the snap knows which was hit.
 *
 * WHAT A POINT-ON-ENTITY SNAP MEANS DEPENDS ON THE STAGE
 * -----------------------------------------------------
 * pointOnEntity is the snap system's "anywhere along this feature"
 * target, so it is always available when the cursor is over a line.
 * If it were taken as a chosen reference on the FIRST click, a student
 * clicking a beam to dimension its span would instead get a point
 * reference to an arbitrary position on it - which is exactly the
 * behaviour §7 of the specification forbids.
 *
 * So on the FIRST click a pointOnEntity snap is ignored in favour of
 * the feature itself (a line dimensions its whole length, a circle its
 * diameter). On the SECOND click it IS a valid point reference,
 * because the student is deliberately choosing a position rather than
 * a whole body.
