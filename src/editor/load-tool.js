/*
 * THE DISTRIBUTED LOAD, AS ONE CONTINUOUS FEATURE
 *
 * A distributed load is not a row of Point Forces. It is one
 * object with a body, a single direction for the whole of it,
 * and a handful of magnitude-defining points. Everything the
 * student does during construction feeds those three things,
 * and the row of arrows is the renderer sampling the result.
 *
 * The workflow is therefore:
 *
 *   1. Click a body. If the click lands on nothing, the tool
 *      falls back to the Line-style two-click span, so a load
 *      can be drawn across empty space exactly as a line can.
 *   2. Move to set the first force: its position along the body
 *      comes from where the cursor is over the body, and its
 *      magnitude and direction come from the offset of the
 *      cursor from that position. This is the ordinary Point
 *      Force interaction, so there is no dialog to open.
 *   3. Click to commit that first force. From here on the
 *      direction is fixed: moving the cursor only changes the
 *      magnitude, and the cursor's position along the body says
 *      where that magnitude applies.
 *   4. Click to add further defining points, then press Enter.
 *
 * Every one of those steps is graphical, in the same rhythm as
 * drawing a polyline.
