/*
 * ========================================================
 * FEATURES THAT HAVE NO LINE, AND SO NO LINE TYPE
 * ========================================================
 *
 * A LINE TYPE DESCRIBES A STROKE, and these features are not strokes.
 *
 * A MOMENT is a curved arrow and a COUPLE is a pair of them. A SUPPORT is
 * a symbol - hatching, rollers, a fixed base - assembled from several
 * short marks of different kinds. A CONNECTION is a joint. None of them is
 * drawn as one continuous line, so "Dashed" or "Centre" has no meaning to
 * apply to: offering the control promised a choice that could not change
 * what is on the sheet, and a student who picked one would reasonably
 * expect to see it happen.
 *
 * LINE WIDTH IS DIFFERENT, AND STAYS.
 *
 * Every one of these is drawn from strokes, and a heavier support symbol
 * is a real and useful thing to want - a small diagram wants a slightly
 * heavier mark at the same size. So only the Line TYPE is removed. Cutting
 * the whole APPEARANCE section would take away the one control here that
 * does something.
 *
 * THIS IS A LIST OF FEATURE TYPES, DELIBERATELY.
 *
 * It is the one place in the panel that has to know which features are
 * stroke-like, because it is the one place deciding what to OFFER rather
 * than what to compute. Everything about how a line is drawn is read from
 * the renderer's own vocabulary; nothing here can drift from what is
 * actually painted, because nothing here describes a line.

     * It used to read "mm", which claimed that a pen width is an engineering
     * length. It is not: the value goes straight to SVG stroke-width, which is
     * a SCREEN property and changes with the view. A beam 500 mm long and one
     * 5000 mm long are drawn with the same pen unless the student changes it,
     * so calling the pen "mm" invited exactly the reading the whole
     * engineering-scale system exists to prevent - that a number in this panel
     * is describing the geometry.
     *
     * "pt" is the conventional name for a line weight, and is not an
     * engineering unit, so the field reads as what it is without claiming to
     * measure the drawing.
     *
     * If this ever becomes an engineering value, the pen has to be scaled by
     * the view transform and stored apart from the geometry - not relabelled
     * here.
