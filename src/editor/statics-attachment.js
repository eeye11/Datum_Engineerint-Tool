         * ========================================================
         *
         * A pin, a roller and a smooth support can sit anywhere along a
         * member, because each restrains one DOF wherever it is built
         * in. A fixed support is different in kind: it restrains EVERY
         * DOF at the point it is built into, so one built into the
         * middle of a member restrains that member at three places and
         * makes it indeterminate in a way the student never drew. The
         * member on the sheet is then not the member being modelled.
         *
         * So the point is SNAPPED to whichever end is nearer, and the
         * support is placed there. Snapping rather than refusing: a
         * student clicking near an end means that end, and "no" would be
         * a worse answer than the nearest thing they wanted.
         *
         * ONLY the fixed support is treated this way. Making every
         * support endpoint-only would break the commonest case in
         * statics - a roller under the middle of a simply supported
         * beam - so the shared placement must keep behaving exactly as
         * it did.
         *
         * The point is snapped HERE rather than inside the factory
         * because the factory is shared by all four supports and has no
         * business knowing which of them has a placement rule. Snapping
         * the point going in keeps the rule with the rule and leaves the
         * factory a pure function of its arguments.

         * X coordinate. That guess is only right when the body starts at the
         * origin and runs along +X - which is why a support on any other
         * member appeared somewhere other than where it was clicked, and
         * usually at an end: a body from x=100 to x=400 with a support
         * clicked at x=250 was filed 250 units along a member whose origin is
         * at 100, so it resolved to x=350 and then clamped toward the far
         * end. A member running diagonally was wrong in the other way, the
         * length being measured along X on a member that leaves X behind.
