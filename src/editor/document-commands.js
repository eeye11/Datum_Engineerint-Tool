 *      not the first: the recovery copy below is what actually preserves the
 *      drawing, since a user can always dismiss a prompt.
 *
 *   2. A PERIODIC SNAPSHOT. A safety net for the failures a change listener
 *      cannot see: a tab that is about to be discarded, a long idle stretch, a
 *      crash that happens with no edit in flight. It is a timer rather than a
