 * drags it. There is no separate "click to select, then drag" step.

 * next press would create a Statics feature with a Geometry tool highlighted, or
 * the reverse. So a category switch ABANDONS the previous tool and establishes
 * a clean interaction state:

 *   - any unfinished construction is cancelled and its preview removed;
 *   - creation-specific mouse state is cleared;
 *   - temporary control handles go with it;
 *   - the previous tool stops responding to mouse events;
 *   - Select becomes active, and owns canvas interaction, in the new category.
 *
 * NOTHING ABOUT THE DRAWING CHANGES. This is why it is NOT `cancelInteraction`
 * verbatim: that also clears the SELECTION, which is an interaction state a
 * category switch has no reason to throw away - a student inspecting a beam
 * should still have it selected after glancing at the Statics tools and coming
 * back. So the selection, the hover and the document are all left exactly as
 * they were, and only the tool and any half-built operation are reset.
 *
 * The re-render reads the category from the DOM, so the caller must have set the
 * new category's button active BEFORE calling this - which is the order the
 * toolbar uses, and the order that makes the tool list and the reset agree about
 * which category Select now belongs to.
