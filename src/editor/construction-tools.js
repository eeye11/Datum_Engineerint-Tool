             * A dimension's references are POINTS: an endpoint, a midpoint, a
             * centre, a point on an entity. Choosing between them is precisely what
             * the shared snapping pipeline does, and it is what a student expects
             * to use - `endpoint to midpoint` is a different dimension from
             * `endpoint to endpoint`, and there is no way to ask for the first when
             * the clicks resolve to the second.
             *
             * Without this the resolver returned the bare pointer, so every click
             * arrived as a raw coordinate with nothing resolved, and `findDimensionTarget`
             * fell back to measuring the whole FEATURE under the cursor. Selecting a
             * midpoint measured the entire line.
             *
             * So the dimension tools go through the same snapping as everything
             * else: same candidates, same tolerance, same indicators, same status
             * wording. Nothing dimension-specific is involved - the measurement
             * layer reads anchors off these features already.

/*
 * Is this click a selection of something that already exists?
 *
 * The decision is made from the INTERACTION STATE and a hit test, not
 * from the active tool. That is the important structural point: there
 * is no list of tools that are allowed to select, so a tool added
 * later is universally selectable the day it is written rather than
 * the day someone remembers to add it to a list.
 *
 *   - A construction is RUNNING      -> no. The click is one of its
 *     own points and belongs to it.
 *   - Nothing under the pointer       -> no. The tool's own handling
 *     deals with empty space.
 *   - Otherwise, something is there   -> yes, and it is selected.
 *
 * WHY A RUNNING CONSTRUCTION ALWAYS WINS
 * -------------------------------------
 * A half-built Beam is waiting for its second point. A click anywhere
 * - including on a feature - is that second point, and taking it for a
 * selection would leave the construction stranded and start an
 * unrelated operation in the middle of it.
 *
 * This is the case that makes universal selection safe rather than
 * reckless, and it is decided by asking the interaction what state it
 * is in. Every multi-click construction in the application - a truss, a
 * distributed load, a statics attachment, a line, a rectangle, an arc
 * - is mid-flight exactly when `phase` is something other than "idle",
 * so one question covers all of them and none can be missed by being
 * absent from a list.
 *
 * The corollary is deliberate: once the construction is committed and
 * the tool is still active, a click on an existing feature selects it.
 * That is what stops a student who has just finished a Moment from
 * starting a second one when they meant to grab the first.
