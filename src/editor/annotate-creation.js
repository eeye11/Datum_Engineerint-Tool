/*
 * ========================================================
 * CREATING AN ANNOTATE FEATURE
 * ========================================================
 *
 * One module drives every Annotate tool - Note, Label, Leader, Callout,
 * Arrow, Symbol, Tolerance and Table - so the tools differ only in their
 * KIND and never in how they are made. A Note and a Leader go through the
 * same arming, the same preview, the same snap resolver, the same commit
 * and the same single undo entry; what changes is which fields the commit
 * fills in.
 *
 * TWO INTERACTION STYLES, DECIDED BY THE KIND
 * -------------------------------------------
 * A POINT-PLACED annotation - a note, a symbol, a tolerance, a table - is
 * placed with ONE click. There is no second point, so inventing a drag for
 * it would be a gesture with nothing to say.
 *
 * A GEOMETRIC annotation - a leader, a callout, an arrow - is a start and
 * an end, so it supports BOTH:
 *
 *     click start -> move -> click end        (click-move-click)
 *     press -> drag -> release                (click-drag)
 *
 * The classification is the SAME one the geometry tools use, and it lives
 * in creation-drag.js: the press arms, the first movement past the
 * threshold starts the feature, and the release commits. This module only
 * says which kinds take part (`isGeometricKind`); it does not re-implement
 * the drag.
 *
 * The one thing that had to be decided here is the CLICK-move-click half
 * for a geometric kind: after the first click the tool holds an anchor and
 * the preview follows the cursor, and the second click commits. That is
 * the `annotateStage` below.
 *
 * WHAT IS NEVER WRITTEN UNTIL THE END
 * -----------------------------------
 * Arming and previewing touch only the interaction. The document is
 * written once, on commit, through the ordinary snapshot/add/commit path -
 * so Escape leaves nothing behind, the preview never enters undo history,
 * and one creation is one undoable action.
