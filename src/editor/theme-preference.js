/*
 * ============================================================
 * CHOOSING A THEME, AND THE DEFAULT DRAWING LINE COLOUR
 * ============================================================
 *
 * A theme preference is ONE decision, but it has TWO effects that must not be
 * allowed to drift:
 *
 *   1. the INTERFACE - applying the preference writes `data-theme` on `<html>`,
 *      which re-points the CSS tokens the whole application is styled through
 *      (`theme.js`);
 *   2. the DEFAULT DRAWING LINE COLOUR - the colour a NEWLY drawn feature is
 *      born with follows the theme too, because a near-black default would be
 *      invisible on the dark sheet and an ice-white one invisible on the light
 *      sheet (`drawing-state.js -> setThemeLineColour`).
 *
 * Only the first is the theme module's business. The theme module is deliberately
 * unable to reach the drawing - see the header of `theme.js`, and the test that
 * pins it - so the pairing lives here, in the editor layer, where both are
 * already in scope.
 *
 * IT CHANGES NO EXISTING FEATURE. `setThemeLineColour` moves only the value a
 * FUTURE feature starts with, and the active sheet's own copy is re-pointed only
 * when the student has not chosen a colour of their own (`strokeExplicit`). No
 * object's stroke is ever rewritten, so geometry, engineering values and the
 * undo history are untouched by a theme change.
