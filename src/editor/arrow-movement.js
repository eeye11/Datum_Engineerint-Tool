/*
 * ========================================================
 * MOVING A SELECTION ONE STEP, IN A DIRECTION
 * ========================================================
 *
 * The arrow keys ask a feature to move a step up, down, left or right. What
 * that means depends on the FEATURE, not on the key:
 *
 *     a free feature        moves freely in the requested direction
 *     a child on a parent   moves only along that parent, staying attached
 *     a fixed / locked one  does not move
 *     a derived child       does not move directly - its parent does
 *
 * THE ONE RULE THAT MUST NEVER BREAK: moving an attached feature must never
 * detach it from its parent. A force on a beam must stay a force on THAT beam,
 * a support must stay pinned to its member, and pressing an arrow a hundred
 * times must not walk something off the geometry it belongs to.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NOT A SWITCH ON FEATURE TYPE
 * ----------------------------------------
 * The temptation is `if (type === "force") ... if (type === "support") ...`, and
 * it is wrong for the same reason the drag code refuses it: the question is not
 * WHAT the feature is but WHERE it is attached, and what shape that parent has.
 * So this module asks, in order:
 *
 *   1. is it movable at all?   (capability: derived / locked / pinned)
 *   2. does it have a parent?  (relation: parentId -> a body with a frame)
 *   3. what does that parent allow?  (its centreline, or its own position)
 *
 * and then projects the requested step onto whatever that parent permits. A
 * curved or inclined parent therefore needs no special case here: the available
 * degrees of freedom come from the parent's own geometry, and the step is
 * projected onto them.
 *
 * IT REUSES THE DRAG'S OWN PATHS. A support is repositioned by the same
 * attachment-fraction rule, a force by the same station along its body, and a
 * free feature by the same `translateObject`. Arrow movement and mouse
 * movement are two ways to ask the same question, so they must not answer it
 * differently.
