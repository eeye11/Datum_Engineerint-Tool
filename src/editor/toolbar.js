		 * says is current - and the tool list and the reset must agree about
		 * which category Select belongs to.
		 *
		 * Existing features are untouched: only the active tool and any unfinished
		 * operation are reset. A switch that had no tool running is therefore the
		 * same clean re-render it always was.
