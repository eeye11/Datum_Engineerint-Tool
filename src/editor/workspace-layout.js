 * ========================================================
 * THE DRAWING'S TOP BARS: HIDE AND SHOW
 * ========================================================
 *
 * The drawing has two rows of chrome above the canvas - the global tool bar
 * and the tool-type bar - and they take vertical space the drawing could use.
 * This folds them away so the canvas grows into the room they gave up.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS NOT.
 *
 * It does not hide the DAETUM header, the document name, or the Written
 * Solution / Engineering Drawing tabs. Those identify the application and
 * choose which page is open; they are not the drawing's chrome, and hiding
 * them would take away the things a student uses to know where they are and
 * to reach the other half of the application. Only the two DRAWING bars go.
 *
 * A THIRD VISIBILITY CONTROL, INDEPENDENT OF THE OTHER TWO.
 *
 * Tools and Features each have their own Hide button and their own collapsed
 * state; this is neither of them. Hiding the bars hides NOTHING else - the
 * two panels keep whatever state they were in - so "bars hidden, Tools
 * visible, Features visible" is a perfectly ordinary state, and so is its
 * opposite. Three controls, three independent states.
 *
 * HOW IT IS IMPLEMENTED, AND WHY IT IS NOT A WIDTH.
 *
 * Collapsing a side panel is a WIDTH change, because the panel sits in a grid
 * column. Collapsing these bars is a HEIGHT change: the two rows they occupy
 * are given up so the flexible canvas row takes them. The state is a single
 * class on `<body>` - `datum-topbar-hidden` - and the stylesheet redefines the
 * layout for it. One class, one place that decides what "hidden" means, and
 * the canvas's own row is unchanged (`minmax(0, 1fr)`), so it simply absorbs
 * the height that was freed.
 *
 * THE DRAWING IS NOT RE-FITTED, for the same reason collapsing a panel does
 * not re-zoom: the student's zoom and pan are theirs. A taller canvas shows
 * more of the drawing at the same scale, which is the whole point.
 *
 * THE STATE IS REMEMBERED FOR THE SESSION, not written to the document - it
 * is a property of how someone is working, not of the drawing they are
 * working on, so it does not belong in a saved file. It is held on the
 * running editor state, which survives ordinary redraws, tool changes and
 * resizes; only a page reload resets it.

/*
 * ========================================================
 * COLLAPSIBLE SIDE PANELS
 * ========================================================
 *
 * The tool panel and the Features panel can each be folded away,
 * so a student on a small screen can hand their horizontal space
 * to the drawing. The canvas is what the work is on; the panels
 * are navigation, and on a laptop they are the first thing worth
 * sacrificing.
 *
 * WHAT COLLAPSING DOES AND DOES NOT DO
 * ------------------------------------
 * It changes the LAYOUT and nothing else. The rail's width
 * changes, the grid's flexible canvas column takes up the
 * difference, and the drawing is re-rendered into a larger or
 * smaller viewport at exactly the zoom, pan and scale it already
 * had. Nothing here calls the zoom, and nothing here touches a
 * document value.
 *
 * That distinction is the whole reason this is not implemented as
 * a browser zoom or a CSS transform. A drawing that is 150% zoomed
 * stays 150%: it simply shows more of itself when a panel closes
 * and less when one opens. The viewport is measured from the
 * canvas element itself on every render, so this needs no
 * adjustment at all - only a redraw.
 *
 * A re-fit or a re-zoom here would be the obvious way to make the
 * canvas "fill" the new space, and it would be wrong: it would
 * move the student's drawing out from under them, change the zoom
 * they are working at, and make the panels feel like they had
 * changed the document.
