 * ============================================================
 * THE COMMANDS THE MENU NEEDS THAT ARE NOT ALREADY A FUNCTION
 * ============================================================
 *
 * Most menu items call a function that already existed - Save, Undo, Cut, Fit.
 * A few needed an operation that existed only INSIDE a click handler on the
 * toolbar: selecting everything, toggling a display setting, and stepping the
 * zoom from somewhere other than the canvas.
 *
 * Each one here is deliberately the SAME operation the toolbar performs, not a
 * second version of it:
 *
 *   selectAllObjects      the same call the Ctrl+A handler makes
 *   toggleDisplaySetting  the same field the toolbar toggle writes, then the
 *                         same synchronisation, so the two cannot disagree
 *   zoomByFactor          the viewport's own zoom, anchored on the canvas centre
