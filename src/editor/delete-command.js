     * ========================================================
     * A DELETION TAKES ITS DEPENDENTS WITH IT
     * ========================================================
     *
     * Deleting a Beam used to leave its Support, its Load, its Moment and
     * its SFD standing, each still naming a member that was no longer
     * there. A support rendered an X - the "missing source" marker - but a
     * diagram had no such marker and simply went on drawing its axes, its
     * x (m) label and its frame. That is where the orphaned-axis report
     * came from: not a renderer leaking nodes, but a FEATURE that had lost
     * its parent and went on being drawn.
     *
     * THE CHILDREN GO, AND THE REASON IS NOT SYMMETRY.
     *
     * None of these features has a meaning without the body: a support has
     * no member to push against, a load no region to act on, a diagram no
     * span to be read against. The student's own work - the expressions in
     * a Plot, the lines in a Sketch - is not discarded as data; it goes
     * because the thing it describes is gone, and Undo brings the whole
     * arrangement back because this is one committed change.
     *
     * ONE PASS, NOT A LOOP.
     *
     * A support may itself have children - its attachment marker - so the
     * descendants are collected first and then removed together. Walking
     * the tree in one pass cannot loop even on a malformed file, and a
     * cycle would not hang the delete.
     *
     * `resolveAnalysisAfterDeletion` below still runs, and still decides
     * what a surviving analysis object means, because a RESULTANT or a
     * COMPONENTS pair is a reading of its sources rather than a child of
     * one: it goes with them only once nothing is left to read.
