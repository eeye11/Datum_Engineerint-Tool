/*
 * ============================================================
 * THE SIX MENUS, AND WHAT EACH COMMAND ACTUALLY CALLS
 * ============================================================
 *
 * This file is the COMMAND MAP: every menu item, and the existing operation it
 * invokes. It contains no behaviour of its own - a menu item whose `run` did
 * real work would be a second implementation of something the application
 * already has, which is the one thing the interface work was told not to do.
 *
 * Each command is therefore one of:
 *
 *   RELOCATED   the operation already existed and is called unchanged. Save,
 *               Undo, Cut, Fit and the display toggles are all of these - the
 *               menu is a new door onto the same room.
 *
 *   SHARED      the operation exists but was only reachable from a toolbar
 *               control. The menu item and the toolbar control call the SAME
 *               function on the SAME state, so the two cannot disagree.
 *
 *   NEW         nothing existed, and the command is built in its own module
 *               rather than here. This file only names it.
 *
 * WHY THE ITEMS ARE BUILT FRESH EVERY TIME A MENU OPENS
 * ----------------------------------------------------
 * Because their state moves. "Undo" is greyed out until there is something to
 * undo; "Show Grid" is ticked while the grid is up. A menu built once at
 * start-up would show the state the application had on load, for the rest of
 * the session. So `items()` is a FUNCTION for each menu, evaluated on open.
