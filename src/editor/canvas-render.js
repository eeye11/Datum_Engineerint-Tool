     * ================================================================
     *
     * A Components pair and a Resultant are not facts about a force; they are
     * statements ABOUT one, and go stale the instant the force changes. So
     * they cannot be refreshed only when an edit is committed.
     *
     * They used to be, and that is why they looked broken. A drag mutates
     * the force on every pointermove and commits once, on release - so the
     * arrow followed the cursor smoothly while its decomposition sat frozen
     * at the value it had when the student first pressed down. The same gap
     * appeared for every uncommitted path: a live resize, a preview, a
     * handle being dragged. Committing was never the missing refresh; it was
     * the only refresh there was.
     *
     * So the refresh goes HERE, in the one function every draw already
     * passes through. That is what makes it complete rather than a longer
     * list of call sites to remember: there is no way to move a force and
     * render it without passing through this. A tool added next month
     * inherits the behaviour by rendering, which is the property worth
     * having, instead of depending on whoever wrote it remembering a call.
     *
     * RECORDS NOTHING. This is a consequence of an edit, not an edit of its
     * own, so the history is untouched - a drag remains one undo entry
     * however many times the pointer moved and however many objects the
     * refresh touched. `commitDrawingChange` still refreshes before it
     * snapshots, so a restored state is consistent; doing it here as well
     * only means the undo entry describes what was on screen at the time.
     *
     * The cost is a map lookup per object on a draw that has already done a
     * full canvas repaint, which is why the registry returns immediately when
     * nothing depends on anything.
