     *
     *   `name`   what it is called in a schedule - "Line 3", "Beam 1"
     *   `label`  what is WRITTEN BESIDE IT ON THE SHEET - "AB", "x", "datum"
     *
     * The Features panel's Label field was bound to `name`, so typing in it
     * silently renamed the feature and the drawing never changed - the field
     * accepted text and did nothing visible, which is exactly the fault
     * reported. This is the branch that makes the field write a LABEL, which the
     * renderer then draws.
     *
     * IT IS HANDLED BEFORE EVERY TYPE BRANCH, so it applies to Line, Point and
     * every other feature through one rule rather than a branch each - the same
     * shape as the name itself.
     *
     * IT IS NOT BLOCKED BY A LOCK. Locking is a constraint on GEOMETRY, and a
     * locked feature must still be labelable: a student fixes a point in place
     * precisely so they can annotate it without moving it. Returning `true` here

     * away, which is 2 m, not 500 mm.

     * coordinate is called `position`, `start`, `end`, `center`, `centre`,
