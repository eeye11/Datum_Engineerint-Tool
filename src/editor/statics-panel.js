 * ========================================================
 * THE ANNOTATION CONTROLS FOR A MAGNITUDE-BEARING FEATURE
 * ========================================================
 *
 * A force, a load, a moment, a resultant and a force-components pair each
 * carry an engineering magnitude, and each can have that magnitude written
 * beside it on the sheet as a box the student can drag to where there is room.
 *
 * These switches control WHETHER that box appears. They do not hold the value
 * - the value belongs to the feature, and the box prints it from there every
 * frame - and they are not the place the magnitude is edited. A number typed
 * here would be a second copy of one already on the force, free to disagree
 * with it.
 *
 * So this is two checkboxes and a heading, and the whole engineering half of
 * the feature is elsewhere.
 *
 * WHY THE BOX IS CONTROLLED TWICE
 *
 * There is a sheet-wide switch as well, and the relationship is deliberate:
 * the per-feature switch may only NARROW the sheet-wide one. A sheet full of
 * twenty forces is unreadable with twenty boxes on it, so a student switches
 * off the seventeen that do not matter; turning the whole class off is not a
 * way to cope, because it also loses the three that did.
 *
 * So a feature switched off here stays off even when the sheet is turned back
 * on - the choice is remembered on the feature, not recomputed from the global
 * switch. `annotationDisplay` is where it is stored, and the annotation model
 * reads the same field, so the checkbox and the box on the sheet cannot
 * disagree about whether it is showing.
 *
 * Only features that actually HAVE a magnitude are given these controls. A
 * beam has no magnitude to annotate, so it gets no ANNOTATION heading - see
 * `magnitudeBearingTypes` below, and note that the section is omitted entirely
 * for every other feature rather than rendered empty.
