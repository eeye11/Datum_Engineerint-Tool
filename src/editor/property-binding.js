     * than on every keystroke is deliberate - a label is a word, not a number,
     * and re-rendering the drawing per letter would be both noisy and slow.

     * reach for the Magnitudes switch on the toolbar - see the note in
     * `magnitudeShownFor`, which reads this same field.
     *
     * It is stored as a real boolean, not as the checkbox's string value, so
     * that reading it back cannot turn the string "false" into a truthy
     * preference and leave the box permanently on.
