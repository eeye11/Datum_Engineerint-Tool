/*
 * Drawing references: one part of the application pointing at a sheet.
 *
 * A reference is not a picture of a drawing. It is a note that says
 * "put sheet sheet_8f31a here", and the drawing is rendered from that
 * sheet's CURRENT contents every time it is looked at.
 *
 * WHY IT IS NOT A COPY
 * --------------------
 * The obvious way to put a drawing into a document is to export it and
 * paste the image. That is wrong here for a reason that is easy to miss:
 * the student is still editing the drawing. An exported image is a
 * photograph of a moment - move the load two millimetres and the
 * figure in the solution is silently, permanently wrong, and there is
 * nothing in either file that knows they were ever related. Every
 * re-export is another chance to forget.
 *
 * So the reference stores a sheetId and nothing else of substance. The
 * chain is:
 *
 *     written reference -> sheetId -> current sheet -> render
 *
 * and the middle step is looked up at render time, so it cannot go
 * stale. Editing the beam updates the figure. Renaming the sheet does
 * not break the figure, because the figure never knew the name.
 * Reordering the tabs does not break it either, because the reference
 * is not a position. What it depends on is exactly one thing - the id -
 * and an id is permanent by design.
 *
 * WHY displayMode EXISTS
 * ---------------------
 * A reference has to say how much of the sheet to show. "fit" is the
 * default and the honest one: it measures the drawing and shows all
 * of it, so the figure matches the sheet however the student happens
 * to be looking at it in the editor. A sheet zoomed to 250% on a
 * detail still prints the whole drawing in the figure, because the
 * figure is a statement about the DRAWING, not about the view.
 *
 * More modes - a fixed scale, a crop, a figure number - can be added
 * without touching the architecture, because the id is what is stored
 * and the mode is only ever consulted while rendering.

   * draw a line otherwise.
