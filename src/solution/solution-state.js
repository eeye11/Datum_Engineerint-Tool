/*
 * ============================================================
 * THE WRITTEN SOLUTION: ITS SOURCE, ITS STRUCTURE, AND ITS SAVE
 * ============================================================
 *
 * The written solution is the other half of a submission. It has ONE source of
 * truth - the LaTeX-ish text the student writes - and everything else the
 * workspace shows is DERIVED from it:
 *
 *   the navigation tree   parsed from the source's own \section commands
 *   the preview           the source, typeset by MathJax
 *   the save status       the source compared with what was last written
 *
 * WHY THE SOURCE IS THE ONLY STATE. A second copy of the structure - a tree the
 * student edits, kept in step with the text by hand - would be the thing that
 * goes stale: a section renamed in the text would keep its old name in the tree
 * until some other code remembered to update it. Parsing the source every time
 * it changes means the two cannot disagree, because there is only one of them.
 *
 * WHAT IS PERSISTED, AND WHERE.
 *
 * The source travels WITH THE DOCUMENT - it is saved into the `.enggdraw` file
 * beside the drawings, so a written solution and its diagrams are one file and
 * opening one brings back the other. A draft is ALSO kept in `localStorage`
 * while the student types, so a closed tab does not lose an unsaved answer;
 * that draft is a safety copy, not a second document.

 * numbers rather than by matching command names in every consumer.
