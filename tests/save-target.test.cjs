/*
 * ========================================================
 * SAVE WRITES BACK TO THE FILE THAT WAS OPENED
 * ========================================================
 *
 * THE BUG THIS PINS DOWN. Save fell through to Save As every time, for a file
 * that had just been opened.
 *
 * The cause was a missing capability, not a wrong branch: `save()` needs a
 * FILE HANDLE, and Open used a plain `<input type="file">`, which hands over a
 * `File` - a read-only snapshot with no way to write back to where it came
 * from. So an opened document had no save target at all, and Save asked the user
 * to choose a filename for a file they had chosen moments earlier.
 *
 * The fix is to open through `showOpenFilePicker` where the browser provides it,
 * because that is the only route that yields a handle Save can write to.
