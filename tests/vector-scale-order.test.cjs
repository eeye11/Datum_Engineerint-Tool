 * IS THE VECTOR SCALE LISTED IN A REASONABLE ORDER, AND A REASONABLE
 * RANGE?
 *
 * A control read top to bottom should read small to large, the way every
 * other quantity on a sheet does. The list used to run 1, 0.1, 0.01,
 * 0.001, 10, 100, 1000 - shrinking then growing - which is the order a
 * user reaches for the values in but makes the list impossible to scan
 * and impossible to tell at a glance which side of 1 an entry is on.
 *
 * It also ran to a thousandfold in each direction, which is a wider range
 * than a drawing control can usefully offer. The list is now the five
 * doublings around 1 a student actually reaches for, in increasing order,
 * with the custom field still there for anything else.
 *
 * The check is on the ORDER, and separately on the things that must not
 * change while reordering: the default is still 1, every value is still
 * present exactly once, and 1 still sits in the middle.
