/*
 * ========================================================
 * WHERE THE APPLICATION'S SOURCE FILES LIVE
 * ========================================================
 *
 * Every test loads the real modules from the real source tree, so every
 * test needs to know where that tree is. It used to answer with the
 * literal string "js/engineering-drawing" - and that path stopped being
 * true when the sources were reorganised by ownership into `core/`,
 * `features/`, `rendering/` and so on.
 *
 * A TEST THAT HARD-CODES A DIRECTORY IS A TEST THAT BREAKS ON A MOVE.
 *
 * So the layout lives here, once, and a test asks for a module BY NAME:
 *
 *     const { modulePath } = require("./helpers/source-path.cjs");
 *
 *     require(modulePath("quantities.js"));
 *
 * The lookup is by BASENAME rather than by full path, because a test's
 * subject is "the quantities module", not "the quantities module at a
 * particular address". That is what makes this resilient: moving a file
 * between folders needs a change in ONE table below, not in every test
 * that happens to load it.
 *
 * The tree is scanned rather than tabulated by hand, so a module added
 * to the application is loadable from a test the moment it exists,
 * without anyone remembering to register it.
