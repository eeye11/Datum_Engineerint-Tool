/*
 * ========================================================
 * SELECTING SEVERAL RECENT FILES
 * ========================================================
 *
 * A recents list accumulates. Removing files one at a time is tedious, so the
 * list can gather several and act on them together.
 *
 * THE ONE RULE THAT MAKES THIS SAFE: SELECTION IS A SEPARATE MODE, NOT A
 * MODIFIER ON OPENING. A row's normal click OPENS the file. While selection mode
 * is on, that same click SELECTS instead - one or the other, never both - so
 * multi-selection is possible without making opening unpredictable.
 *
 * And the two destructive-sounding actions are kept strictly apart:
 *
 *   Remove from Recents   touches Datum's record ONLY. Works when the file is
 *                         missing, because it never needs the file.
 *   Delete File           the real thing, confirmed by the caller.
