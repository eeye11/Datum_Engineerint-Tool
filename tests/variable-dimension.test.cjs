/*
 * ========================================================
 * VARIABLE DIMENSION: THE SAME SELECTION, A DIFFERENT ANSWER
 * ========================================================
 *
 * The requirement is a SIBLING relationship, not a second system:
 *
 *     Smart Dimension     geometry -> place -> MEASURED value
 *     Variable Dimension  geometry -> place -> the STUDENT'S value
 *
 * So the two must agree about WHAT is being dimensioned - one line is a length,
 * two non-parallel lines are an angle - and differ only in where the answered
 * value comes from.
 *
 * The defects this pins:
 *
 *   1. A Variable Dimension used to commit IMMEDIATELY on placement, with a
 *      default symbol `x`, and never asked. A student got a feature stating a
 *      name they had not chosen.
 *
 *   2. The panel READ `geometry.symbol` and the setter WROTE `geometry.symbol`,
 *      while the model stores the symbol ON the feature (`variable.symbol`).
 *      So the student's own symbol was invisible in the panel, and an edit
 *      appeared to do nothing.
 *
 *   3. The symbol was not reduced to a number anywhere it should not be, but
 *      nothing proved it - so `L/2` surviving verbatim is asserted here.
