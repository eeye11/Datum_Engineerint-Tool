/*
 * DEFECTS THAT ONLY SHOWED UP WHEN THE CODE RAN.
 *
 * Each of these lived on main because the code that failed called a name
 * that did not exist in its scope. Classic scripts give no warning for that;
 * it fails only when the line runs, and then only as an error in the
 * console. The move to ES modules made ESLint able to see them; these tests
 * keep them from coming back by running the real code in the booted editor.
 *
 *   - Selecting a Triangle: 'finaliseRows is not defined', so its
 *     Features panel never rendered.
 *   - Placing a Distributed Load: 'section is not defined', so the tool
 *     could never create a load.
 *   - Undo/redo across a sheet change: 'renderSheetTabs is not defined'.
 *     The history swallowed the error, so the canvas and the panel were
 *     simply never re-rendered after the sheets were restored.
 *   - Arming an SFD/BMD/AFD tool and clicking off a member: a TypeError in
 *     analysisSourceBody.
 *   - The Varying Distributed Load could not be built: its build phase was
 *     left out when the uniform load's steps were given their own set, so
 *     each click fell through and the tool reset.
