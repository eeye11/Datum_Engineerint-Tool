/*
 * ========================================================
 * SAVING IS NOT AN EDIT, AND THE IMAGE IS NOT A SCREENSHOT
 * ========================================================
 *
 * Two invariants that are easy to lose and hard to see:
 *
 *   1. SAVE AND SAVE AS ADD NO HISTORY ENTRY. Saving writes the document; it
 *      does not change it. If a save ever went through commitDrawingChange,
 *      the student's next Ctrl+Z would undo the SAVE rather than the last edit
 *      they made - which is a genuinely confusing thing for a file to do.
 *
 *   2. THE IMAGE IS RENDERED FROM THE MODEL, NOT CAPTURED FROM THE SCREEN.
 *      A screenshot would carry the toolbar, the Feature panel, the cursor,
 *      the snap marker and the selection highlight into the file. The export
 *      must go through the drawing renderer and produce a drawing-only snip.
 *
 * These are checked against the source, because they are properties of which
 * functions call which - not of any single value - and the failure mode is
 * silent: the file still saves, it just saves the wrong thing.
