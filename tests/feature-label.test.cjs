 *
 * The Features panel's Label field accepted text and did nothing: the input had
 * NO HANDLER anywhere, and it was bound to the feature's NAME rather than to a
 * label. Line and Point were both affected, because the field is shared.
 *
 * These check the whole path a label takes - the setter, the model, and the
 * three things the field must NOT disturb - so a regression in any of them is
 * caught here rather than by a student noticing that their label never appeared.
