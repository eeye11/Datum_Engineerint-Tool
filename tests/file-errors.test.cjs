/*
 * ========================================================
 * FILE PROBLEMS ARE HANDLED, NOT CRASHED
 * ========================================================
 *
 * Every way a file can fail has to end in a message and an UNCHANGED drawing -
 * never an exception, never a blank workspace, never a lost drawing:
 *
 *   unreadable        the browser cannot read it (permissions, a dead drive)
 *   empty             0 bytes: nothing to open, and a different problem from
 *                     "damaged" because the answer is different
 *   not-json          text that is not a drawing at all
 *   wrong-format      JSON that is not an EnggDraw file
 *   from-the-future   written by a newer build
 *   too-old           below the minimum this build supports
 *   no-document-body  a valid envelope with nothing in it
 *
 * TWO RULES THE IMPLEMENTATION MUST KEEP, both of which were once broken:
 *
 *   1. `window.alert` IS NOT USED. It blocks the page, cannot be styled, and
 *      THROWS where dialogs are suppressed - so a handled error becomes an
 *      uncaught one, and the failure being reported is replaced by a worse one
 *      from the reporting itself.
 *
 *   2. A file problem NEVER touches the open document. The read and the
 *      validation both happen before anything is applied.
