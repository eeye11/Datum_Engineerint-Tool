/*
 * ========================================================
 * DOES A PANEL DESCRIBE THE FEATURE, OR THE MODEL BEHIND IT?
 * ========================================================
 *
 * The Features panel is an engineering interface. It is not an inspector, and
 * the difference is not cosmetic: a student who reads "Feature Type
 * analysis-diagram" has learned something about Datum's internals and nothing
 * about the diagram they drew on their beam.
 *
 * Three things leaked that model vocabulary into the panel:
 *
 *   1. A read-only "Feature Type" field. It restated the panel's own title in
 *      a second vocabulary, and for any feature without a friendly label the
 *      second vocabulary was the internal type string.
 *   2. The analysis diagrams and the derived force features had no entry in
 *      the label table, so they fell through to that raw type - which is how
 *      an SFD was titled "shear-force-diagram".
 *   3. The header itself, once the redundant field was gone, had to come from
 *      the shared module so the title and the editable name are built the
 *      same way as every other field.
 *
 * The checks are against the source and the shared module, because these
 * panels need a live canvas to render; what is asserted is the wiring and the
 * label table, which is where the defect was.
