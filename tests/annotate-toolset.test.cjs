/*
 * ========================================================
 * THE ANNOTATE TOOLSET HAS THE STATICS SHAPE
 * ========================================================
 *
 * The requirement is structural and specific: Annotate is organised the way
 * Statics is - a short list of CATEGORY headings, each with its commands
 * listed DIRECTLY underneath - and the categories do not hide commands.
 *
 * That is easy to undo by accident: a `submenu: true` added to one entry
 * turns that command into a parent that has to be clicked before it can be
 * used, and nothing would throw. So the shape is asserted here.
