 * ========================================================
 * WHAT THE ANALYSIS GRAPH ALREADY DOES
 * ========================================================
 *
 * The specification for the analysis workflow lists a long set of graph
 * requirements. Several of them look unimplemented from the outside - there
 * is no "cursor readout" anywhere on screen, no tick spacing control, no
 * y-range field - so the first instinct is to write them.
 *
 * This asks the question directly instead, because building a second
 * implementation of something the renderer already does would leave the
 * two disagreeing. Anything reported here as MISSING is genuinely absent;
 * anything PRESENT means the requirement is already met and re-implementing
 * it would be a regression, not progress.
