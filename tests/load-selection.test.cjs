/*
 * ========================================================
 * CAN THE SELECT TOOL REACH A DISTRIBUTED LOAD?
 * ========================================================
 *
 * A distributed load is drawn as a field: a row of arrows standing off the
 * body along its normal, closed by an envelope. Almost none of that ink is
 * near the two points the model stores, so a hit test that looks near those
 * points - which is what every other feature gets - catches almost nothing.
 *
 * The symptom was that clicking a load selected whatever was behind it. For
 * a uniform load the biggest, most obvious target on the screen is the
 * envelope - a rectangle sitting clear of the beam - and clicking the
 * middle of it was the one click a student is guaranteed to try.
 *
 * Three things are drawn and all three must be hittable:
 *
 *   1. an arrow shaft
 *   2. the envelope, from inside and just outside its edge
 *   3. the body line between the two stations
 *
 * And the arrow length used to test them has to be the one the RENDERER
 * draws with, or the hit region drifts away from the ink as soon as the
 * student zooms or changes the Vector Scale.
