/*
 * DOES THE DEPENDENCY SYSTEM HOLD THE WHOLE SHEET TOGETHER?
 *
 * The individual mechanisms are each proven elsewhere: a components
 * object follows its force, a resultant follows its forces, a diagram
 * follows its body, a support slides along its member. What none of those
 * tests covers is the thing they all depend on - that ONE refresh runs on
 * EVERY committed edit, so that no tool can be written that forgets it.
 *
 * That is the claim worth testing, and it is a claim about coverage rather
 * than about arithmetic. So this file does not move a force by calling the
 * refresh, which would prove nothing: it goes through the ordinary
 * commitDrawingChange, exactly as a dragged handle or a typed magnitude
 * does, and asks whether the dependent objects are correct afterwards.
 *
 * THE ORDER MATTERS AND IS THE SUBSTANCE OF IT. The refresh runs BEFORE
 * the snapshot is taken for Undo, so an undone edit returns to a state in
 * which the dependents were already right. Undoing the other way round
 * would restore a components object still describing where the force used
 * to be - a state no student would ever see by hand, and one they would
 * quite reasonably report as Undo being broken.

 * READS every part of the force that can change.
 *
 * A refresh that watched the position but not the unit would keep up with a
 * drag and go stale on a unit change, and it would do so silently - the
 * dependent would be updated, just from part of its source. So each part of
 * a force that a student can edit is changed here on its own, and the
 * dependents are asked to catch up through the ordinary refresh. If any one
 * of these reads a field the derivation ignores, it fails.
 *
 * A FRESH DRAWING, because the checks above have moved and re-aimed force A
 * many times over, and reusing it would make the expected numbers depend on
 * the order the earlier checks ran in.
