 * ========================================================
 * DO ALL THE VECTORS POINT THE SAME WAY?
 * ========================================================
 *
 * A Statics sheet mixes five kinds of arrow - a Point Force, a Resultant,
 * a Force Components' three vectors, and the two distributed loads - and a
 * student comparing them is comparing arrowheads. If two of them decide
 * their direction differently, the drawing is making a claim it cannot
 * back up, and it does so silently.
 *
 * ========================================================
 * THE CONVENTION
 * ========================================================
 *
 *     tail --> head,   and the head sits at `head`.
 *
 * Derived from the two endpoints, in screen space, after the world-to-
 * screen transform. Not from a sign, and not from an angle that has been
 * negated to compensate for something else.
 *
 * This has been got wrong twice, in two different ways, and both are worth
 * recording:
 *
 *   1. A force-only routine took an ANGLE and rebuilt the tip with
 *      `y: anchor.y - Math.sin(angle) * length`. The anchor was already a
 *      SCREEN point, so that minus inverted the vector a second time. The
 *      caller passed a negated angle to compensate, and the two errors
 *      cancelled - which is why it survived, and why neither could be
 *      changed without breaking the other.
 *
 *   2. A direction was recovered from two screen points with
 *      `atan2(-dy, dx)` and handed to a routine that applied its own
 *      inversion, for the same reason.
 *
 * Both are the same mistake: doing the world-to-screen conversion twice,
 * in two places, with the errors arranged to cancel.
 *
 * So the shared renderer takes TWO POINTS and measures its own direction,
 * and this checks every vector type against that one rule - including the
 * loads, which use a different head SHAPE but must use the same rule for
 * which end the head is on.
