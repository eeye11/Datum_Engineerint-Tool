/*
 * ========================================================
 * SMART DIMENSION ON A TRIANGLE DIMENSIONS THE SIDE CLICKED
 * ========================================================
 *
 * A triangle is ONE feature with THREE measurable sides. Clicking a side must
 * identify THAT side - not the whole shape, and not whichever side happened
 * to be stored first.
 *
 * These drive the real hit test and the real anchor resolution, so they test
 * the reading the tool actually uses.
 *
 * The defect they pin down: a triangle was not treated as a chain of segments
 * at all, so it fell through to the feature's own `start`/`end`. Every click
 * on the shape therefore resolved to the same two stored points, whatever the
 * student aimed at - which is why one side always won.
