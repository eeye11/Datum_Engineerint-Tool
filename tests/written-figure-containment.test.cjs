/*
 * ========================================================
 * A FIGURE IN THE WRITTEN SOLUTION STAYS IN ITS PANE
 * ========================================================
 *
 * THE DEFECT: pressing Update Output with a drawing reference in the LaTeX
 * source put the drawing over the whole page, with no way to dismiss it.
 *
 * It was NOT a modal, and nothing escaped into the document - measured, the
 * body still held only the header, the page and the script. The figure had
 * simply OVERFLOWED its container: it was sized by WIDTH alone
 * (`width: 100%; height: auto`), so its height followed the drawing's aspect
 * ratio with no ceiling, and a wide drawing in the 395px-tall Rendered Solution
 * pane came out taller than the pane and covered the workspace.
 *
 * This is the same class as the Open popup's preview escape: a replaced element
 * sized by one axis, in a container that cannot bound the other.
 *
 * The fix bounds it in BOTH directions, so the drawing is scaled down to fit and
 * never stretched.
