/*
 * ========================================================
 * SMART DIMENSION: A SECOND LINE AFTER THE FIRST IS AN ANGLE
 * ========================================================
 *
 * THE DEFECT: clicking one line with Smart Dimension jumped the tool straight
 * into PLACEMENT. The very next click was therefore read as "where to stand
 * the length dimension", never as a second reference - so a student could not
 * click a second line after the first to dimension the angle between them.
 * The angle path existed (`descriptorIsComplete` -> "angular") but was
 * unreachable from the click sequence.
 *
 * The fix is an ARMED stage: the first click previews its own measurement at
 * once but the tool keeps accepting references, and only a click that lands on
 * NO reference (or Enter) places it. These checks read the flow out of the
 * source, the way the other dimension tests do, because the interaction needs
 * a real pointer sequence to run.
