/*
 * ========================================================
 * ONE UNIT CONTROL FOR EVERY UNIT-BEARING FEATURE
 * ========================================================
 *
 * Every feature with a value and a unit must let the student SEE and CHANGE
 * that unit from the Features panel - a force, a moment, a distributed load, a
 * dimension. The unit control is ONE component, the units come from ONE table,
 * and changing the unit is a CONVERSION, not a relabel.
 *
 * The defects this pins:
 *
 *   1. EVERY PANEL BUILT ITS OWN UNIT SELECT. A force, a moment and a load
 *      each assembled a `<select>` by hand, so their widths, their options and
 *      their behaviour could drift apart - and did.
 *
 *   2. THE UNIT WAS WRITTEN AS A BOOLEAN. The generic panel select handler wrote
 *      `geometry[key] = value === "true"`, which is right for a checkbox-shaped
 *      select and wrong for a unit: choosing kN stored `forceUnit = false`, the
 *      dropdown snapped back on the next repaint, and nothing said why. That is
 *      what made a Moment's unit control look decorative.
 *
 *   3. THE UNIT LISTS WERE DUPLICATED. `["kN/m","N/mm"]` was written out beside
 *      the quantity table's own list, so a unit could exist in one and not the
 *      other.
 *
 *   4. A DIMENSION HAD NO UNIT CONTROL AT ALL. Its value is measured in the
 *      sheet's own unit, and there was no way to READ it in cm or m without
 *      changing the geometry. It now converts for display only, so the
 *      dimension stays DRIVING.
