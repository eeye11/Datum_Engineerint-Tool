 * ========================================================
 * DO COMPONENTS AND RESULTANTS FOLLOW THEIR SOURCES?
 * ========================================================
 *
 * Two reports:
 *
 *   1. Force Components draws a REPLICA of the parent force.
 *   2. Neither Components nor Resultant updates when the source changes.
 *
 * ========================================================
 * THE REPLICA
 * ========================================================
 *
 * A Components object stores the whole vector on itself - `original`, and
 * the legacy `start`/`end` - because its renderer and hit test read them,
 * and because it IS a reading of the source. Storing it is defensible.
 *
 * DRAWING it is not. The renderer's test was `showOriginal !== false`,
 * which draws the original whenever the field is absent - and nothing ever
 * writes that field, so it was absent on every Components object ever
 * created. The feature therefore drew the force AND its two components:
 * the student saw their own force twice, and the tool read as a copy of it
 * with a triangle drawn over the top.
 *
 * The Features panel had the same wrong default, and the two cancelled out
 * to "always on": unticking the checkbox set the field to `false`, and
 * `false !== false` is false, so nothing appeared to happen.
 *
 * The default is now OFF, and only an explicit `true` turns it on. Showing
 * the decomposed vector alongside its components is genuinely useful for
 * checking the work, so it stays available - it just is not the default.
 *
 * ========================================================
 * THE UPDATING
 * ========================================================
 *
 * Every individual function works: `refreshAnalysis`, `deriveResultant`
 * and `deriveForceComponents` all produce correct values when called
 * directly. What was missing was the COMMIT reaching them.
 *
 * `analysis-dependencies` registers itself with the state module at the
 * end of its own load, so `drawing-state` must already be loaded. Loaded
 * the other way round the registration finds nothing, the state module
 * never learns where the registry is, and `commitDrawingChange` silently
 * refreshes nothing.
 *
 * That is a failure with no error, no empty value and no stack: every
 * function passes when called directly, and the product still stops
 * following its source. So these go through the COMMIT - the only path a
 * student's edit takes - rather than calling the refresh themselves, which
 * would prove the function works rather than that the product updates.
