/*
 * ========================================================
 * DOES A LOAD ACT WHERE IT SAYS IT DOES?
 * ========================================================
 *
 * A Distributed Load is a REGION of a body plus a direction. It is not a
 * position in space, and nothing about it is free: which part of the member
 * it covers, and which side of the member it acts from, follow from those
 * two facts.
 *
 * Two reports came out of that being untrue:
 *
 *   1. The panel offered six numbers for those two facts - Offset X,
 *      Offset Y, Start Y, End Y as well as the two stations - with the
 *      load's outline height stored independently of the body and the
 *      direction. Nothing kept them consistent, so the load could be
 *      described into a state it could not be drawn in.
 *   2. Reversing a load moved its outline to the other side of the member.
 *
 * The second is the sharper one. `loadBodyNormal` derived the sense of the
 * span's normal from the load's CURRENT direction - the same field the
 * reverse control writes - so a reversal re-derived it, flipped it, and
 * carried the whole field of force lines across the beam. The comment
 * beside it claimed a reversal "leaves this agreement - and therefore the
 * drawn line - alone". It did not leave it alone, and the comment described
 * the intended behaviour while the code did the opposite.
 *
 * The fix is to pin the side once, when the load's direction is first set,
 * and read it back unchanged afterwards: which side a load acts from is a
 * fact about the region, not a consequence of which way it currently
 * pushes.
