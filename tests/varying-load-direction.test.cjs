/*
 * ========================================================
 * THE VARYING DISTRIBUTED LOAD'S DIRECTION COMES FROM THE CURSOR
 * ========================================================
 *
 * The varying load used to read its direction from the vector between the
 * cursor and the cursor's own projection onto the body. That vector is the
 * foot of a perpendicular, so it is ALWAYS square-on to the parent body -
 * the cursor's actual direction never reached the load, and a student
 * moving diagonally still got a perpendicular force.
 *
 * The direction now comes from a FIXED reference point - the midpoint of
 * the loaded region, the same origin the constant load uses - so the
 * cursor's real angle becomes the load's direction while the magnitude
 * profile is left exactly as it was.
 *
 * These checks drive `distributedLoadDraft`, the one function that turns
 * the interaction plus the cursor into the load, so they test the real
 * reading rather than a copy of it.
