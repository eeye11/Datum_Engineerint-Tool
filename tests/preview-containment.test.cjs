 * ========================================================
 * A PREVIEW CANNOT ESCAPE ITS THUMBNAIL
 * ========================================================
 *
 * The Open popup injects a stored preview as an SVG STRING. That is what made
 * pressing Open put a full-size drawing on the page: the box had a fixed height
 * but the `<svg>` inside was a flex item on the default `display: inline`, and a
 * replaced element in that state keeps its own intrinsic `width="760"` - so it
 * drew at its own pixel size and burst out of a 54px square.
 *
 * Three rules have to hold together, and the CLIP is the one that actually
 * guarantees it: whatever dimensions a stored preview carries - including one
 * written by an older build before previews were fitted - it can only ever be
 * drawn INSIDE its box.
