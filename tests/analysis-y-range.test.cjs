 * ========================================================
 * THE Y RANGE

 *
 * The graph's vertical scale is DERIVED by default - whatever the largest
 * value happens to be is fitted to the frame. A student who has just typed
 * one equation should see it fill the box, not sit as a flat line along the
 * axis.
 *
 * A SET range overrides that, and the decision worth testing is HOW. It
 * clips rather than replaces: the frame is widened to hold whichever is
 * larger, the student's range or their own diagram.
 *
 * The alternative - draw to the set range and let anything taller run off
 * the top - is silent. A curve that leaves the frame is indistinguishable
 * from a curve that stops there, and a student would read the second as
 * their own answer. So the unit height is chosen from the larger of the two,
 * and nothing is ever quietly trimmed.
