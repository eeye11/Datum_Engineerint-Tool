/*
 * ========================================================
 * EVERY NAMED IMPORT RESOLVES
 * ========================================================
 *
 * THE DEFECT THIS PINS. `selection.js` imported `objectIntersectsSelection` from
 * `box-selection.js`, but that module had the function under a different name. A
 * named import of a symbol a module does not export is a SYNTAX ERROR in the
 * browser - not a runtime `undefined` - so the whole module graph failed to
 * evaluate from that point on.
 *
 * The symptom was nowhere near the cause: `main.js` stops where it imports the
 * broken chain, so the menu bar, the command search and the drawing editor's own
 * wiring never ran, and the ENGINEERING DRAWING TAB did nothing when clicked -
 * the section never became active. No console error appeared in the app's own log,
 * because the failure happened before any of it was installed.
 *
 * A unit test could not catch it either: `require()` of an ES module in the test
 * harness resolves through a shim that tolerates a missing name, so every test
 * passed while the APPLICATION could not start. That is the gap this file closes,
 * by checking the SOURCE of every named import against the SOURCE of the module
 * it imports - the same question the browser asks, answered without a browser.
