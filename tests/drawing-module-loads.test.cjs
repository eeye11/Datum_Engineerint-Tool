/*
 * THE WHOLE APPLICATION BOOTS.
 *
 * Every other test exercises a module, or a function lifted out of one. None
 * of them can see a fault that only appears when the application starts: a
 * module that throws while it is being evaluated, an import that names
 * something its target does not export, a start-up step that runs before
 * the element it needs exists. Those break the page for every student, and
 * they are invisible to a test of the parts.
 *
 * So this loads the real page - index.html's own markup - into jsdom, then
 * loads the application's entry module, src/main.js, exactly as the browser
 * does, and checks that the editor came up in a working state.
