/*
 * DOES AN ANALYSIS DIAGRAM DRAW?
 *
 * The feature appeared in the Features panel and the status line said
 * "Reference axis placed" while the canvas showed nothing at all. So
 * "the feature exists" proved to be no evidence that "the feature renders",
 * and this file renders one for real and looks at the output.
 *
 * The whole path, in Node with no browser:
 *
 *     axis from the source  ->  the factory  ->  the renderer
 *
 * The renderer's own rule is that a feature group is appended ONLY if it
 * drew at least one child, so an empty group is the signature of a branch
 * that returned early. That is what is asserted against.
 *
 * ONE LEVEL BODY ONLY, deliberately. This file answers a single question,
 * and every extra case is another DOM stub that can be wrong for reasons
 * that have nothing to do with the bug.
