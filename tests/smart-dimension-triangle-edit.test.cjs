/*
 * ========================================================
 * EDITING A TRIANGLE SIDE CHANGES THAT SIDE
 * ========================================================
 *
 * §8 of the brief: changing a dimension on AB must change AB - not the
 * hypotenuse, and not whichever side the triangle happens to store first.
 *
 * §17: selection must work at every zoom. The hit test is expressed in
 * screen pixels and converted to world units through the camera, so the same
 * physical click lands on the same side however far in or out the view is.
