/*
 * ========================================================
 * READING A CURSOR IN THE GRAPH'S OWN UNITS
 * ========================================================
 *
 * The status readout reports world coordinates, because that is what the
 * sheet is drawn in. But a student sketching a shear diagram does not want
 * the world y of a pixel - they want the VALUE they are at, and how far
 * along the member they are.
 *
 * The property that matters is that it AGREES WITH THE DRAWING. So these
 * round-trip: a point is converted into world, then read back, and the two
 * must be the same value. A readout that disagreed with the curve beside it
 * by even a factor would be worse than no readout, because it would be
 * believed.
