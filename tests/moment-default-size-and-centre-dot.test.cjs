/*
 * ========================================================
 * A MOMENT'S DEFAULT SIZE, AND ITS APPLICATION POINT
 * ========================================================
 *
 * Two small presentation changes, both about the moment reading correctly on
 * the sheet:
 *
 *   1. The DEFAULT radius was raised slightly, so a freshly placed moment is
 *      not tight around its own centre. It is a DEFAULT only - a moment that
 *      carries its own `arcRadius` keeps it, and the magnitude, direction and
 *      attachment behaviour are untouched.
 *
 *   2. A CENTRE DOT marks the moment's application point. It is drawn at the
 *      arc's own centre, at the moment's attachment coordinate, in screen space
 *      at a fixed size - so it is visible at every zoom and never swells when
 *      zoomed in. It is not a separate feature.
