/*
 * ========================================================
 * THE TWO HIDE BUTTONS ARE A MATCHED PAIR
 * ========================================================
 *
 * Each panel has a Hide button, and each must sit on its panel's OUTER edge -
 * against the window, not against the canvas.
 *
 * THE BUG THIS PINS DOWN. The two rails were mirrored with `row-reverse`, which
 * reverses EVERYTHING rather than just placing the button last. Measured on a
 * 1280px window:
 *
 *     Tools     button x=21,    panel 43..222     outside-left   (right)
 *     Features  button x=1024,  panel 1046..1259  INSIDE-left    (wrong)
 *
 * Two controls doing the same job to two panels, and one of them was on the
 * wrong side - so they did not read as the same control at all.
 *
 * The rule is now stated ONCE: the button is always the outermost thing in its
 * rail. Each side says only which direction that is, and neither reverses the
 * whole row.
