/*
 * ========================================================
 * DOES THE ANALYSIS GRAPH HAVE A COORDINATE SYSTEM?
 * ========================================================
 *
 * A Plot or Sketch frame is meant to read as a set of axes a student plots
 * against, not as a picture of a diagram. The y-axis in particular has to
 * span the WHOLE graph - top to bottom, empty or full - because it is the
 * thing a value is read against.
 *
 * Two versions of this got it wrong, and they are different mistakes:
 *
 *   1. The frame was 92px above the axis and 46px below. That is not a
 *      neutral layout, it is a claim that twice as much ordinate is
 *      available above as below - and for a shear force or bending moment
 *      diagram that is exactly backwards, because those are the quantities
 *      that change sign. The smaller half is the one holding the answers.
 *
 *   2. The y-axis was measured from the CONTENT in one version, so a
 *      student checking the size of a jump was reading it against an axis
 *      the jump had itself resized.
 *
 * The axis must therefore come from the GRAPH FRAME, and be the same
 * length whatever has been drawn in it. That is checked here by rendering
 * the same feature with and without a curve and comparing the axis.
