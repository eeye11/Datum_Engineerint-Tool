/*
 * ========================================================
 * FIT COVERS EVERY FEATURE TYPE
 * ========================================================
 *
 * Fit answers one question: how big is the DRAWING? The answer must include
 * everything that is drawn, and two kinds of feature used to give a wrong one.
 *
 * A POINT AND A PARTICLE were measured from their single defining position, so
 * their bounds were a ZERO-SIZE box. A zero-size drawing makes Fit zoom in to
 * the maximum looking for an extent that is not there - and a point is not
 * nothing: it is a marker with a visible radius, and that radius is what the
 * drawing occupies.
 *
 * AN ANALYSIS DIAGRAM was measured from its axis span, which has NO HEIGHT. The
 * frame the student sketches in extends well above and below that axis, so the
 * frame hung outside the fitted view - the fit cropped the very area the diagram
 * exists to provide.
 *
 * Both are fixed by measuring what is DRAWN, and the frame's dimensions live in
 * a leaf module so the renderer and the fit cannot disagree about them.
