/*
 * ========================================================
 * THE DISTRIBUTED LOAD'S DIRECTION DOES NOT ROTATE AS THE CURSOR MOVES
 * ========================================================
 *
 * After a Distributed Load's span is defined, the tool must establish ONE
 * fixed reference point - the midpoint of the loaded region - and measure the
 * magnitude/direction vector from that point to the ACTUAL CURSOR.
 *
 * The bug this file pins down: the vector was measured to the resolved
 * construction point, which is SNAPPED. Near an end of the span that point IS
 * the end, so the vector became the fixed midpoint-to-endpoint diagonal and
 * the load swung to a strange angle as the cursor crossed the span - the
 * direction rotating under the student for no reason they asked for.
 *
 * Three things must therefore hold:
 *
 *   1. The origin is the loaded region's midpoint, captured once and never
 *      recomputed from a moving cursor.
 *   2. The direction is measured to the raw (or H/V-constrained) cursor, never
 *      to the snapped construction point.
 *   3. Moving the cursor laterally changes the direction only through the
 *      vector geometry - never by jumping to an endpoint.
 *
 * These drive `constantLoadDraft`, the one function that turns the
 * interaction plus a cursor into the load, so they test the real reading.
