/*
 * THE FEATURE MATRIX, driven through the path the Dimension tool uses.
 *
 * The specification's mapping table lists what should be dimensionable
 * and labellable for every feature type. Until this file existed, that
 * table had been checked only against the measurement layer in
 * isolation - and the UI path had been exercised on exactly TWO rows,
 * Line and Rectangle.
 *
 * That gap was not academic. Four real defects surfaced the moment other
 * feature types were driven through it, none visible to unit tests of
 * the models alone:
 *
 *   - bodies could not be picked by clicking inside them, because the
 *     anchor helper returns anchor NAMES and the picker wanted points;
 *   - a pair of features could be recognised but never expressed,
 *     because the descriptor builder was not exported;
 *   - a polygon and a triangle offered a DIAMETER, measured between
 *     two arbitrary vertices - a chord, labelled as a diameter;
 *   - a coordinate measurement crashed, because a lone reference left
 *     the measurement one point short of the two it needs.
 *
 * Every object here is built by the same factories the application uses,
 * so a mismatch between a factory and a model shows up in this file
 * rather than on screen.
 *
 * TWO LESSONS BAKED IN, both learned by getting them wrong first:
 *
 *   1. The factories take POSITIONAL arguments. Passing objects made
 *      every row report "nothing to measure" - indistinguishable from
 *      a feature that genuinely is not dimensionable.
 *
 *   2. feature-geometry is loaded for REAL. Rectangle and polygon
 *      anchors derive from it, and stubbing it out as empty arrays -
 *      the pattern the other model tests use - deletes those anchors
 *      and produces the same false "nothing to measure" report.
 *
 * A test whose job is to catch false failures must never manufacture
 * one and then believe it.
 *
 * Pure modules, so this runs in Node.
