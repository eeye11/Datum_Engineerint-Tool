/*
 * ========================================================
 * THE FEATURE PANELS SHARE ONE VOCABULARY
 * ========================================================
 *
 * Every Statics and Analysis feature panel is built by a large function in
 * drawing.js. Its fields used to be assembled by hand - fifteen local copies of
 * "number", "section", "readOnly" and "scalar", each drifting - and that is
 * where the floating commas, the dangling separators and the "NaN" came from.
 *
 * The panels now route through the one property-panel module, which enforces
 * two rules in the data-to-display layer rather than hiding the symptom with
 * CSS:
 *
 *   1. NO PUNCTUATION WITHOUT A VALUE. A field whose value is missing is not
 *      emitted at all, so a panel cannot show "Direction: ," or leave a stray
 *      comma where an optional property was absent.
 *
 *   2. NO EMPTY SECTIONS. A heading stands or falls with the fields under it.
 *
 * These are asserted at two levels: against the shared module (which does the
 * work), and against the panel source (that it actually delegates to it rather
 * than carrying a private dialect). The second is what stops a later edit from
 * quietly reintroducing the defect while the module still tests green.
