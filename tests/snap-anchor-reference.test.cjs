/*
 * DOES A SNAP BECOME A DIMENSION REFERENCE?
 *
 * The join between two vocabularies:
 *
 *   a snap     says  objectId + KIND  ("endpoint", "midpoint")
 *   a reference says featureId + ANCHOR ("start", "end", "center")
 *
 * Nothing converted between them, so a click on a real endpoint had no anchor
 * name to store and could not become a reference at all. This exercises the
 * conversion directly, because the failure it prevents is silent: the tool
 * quietly falls back to measuring the whole feature under the cursor, which
 * looks like it works.
