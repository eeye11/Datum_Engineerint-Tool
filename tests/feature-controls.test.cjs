/*
 * ========================================================
 * FEATURE CONTROLS: LOCK AND CONSTRAIN
 * ========================================================
 *
 * THE LOCK stops a feature being MOVED. It is deliberately narrow:
 *
 *   - a locked feature is still selectable, still inspectable, still listed
 *   - its properties are still editable through the panel
 *   - unlocking restores normal movement
 *   - the flag travels with the document, so a lock survives Save and Open
 *
 * A lock that also made a feature unselectable or uneditable would not be a
 * lock; it would be a way to lose access to your own drawing.
 *
 * THE CONSTRAIN TOGGLE is checked here too, because the two controls live
 * beside each other and the same mistake would apply to either: a constraint
 * must be REMOVABLE. Checking it pins a value; unchecking it must delete the
 * pin, not leave a constraint that can never be cleared.
