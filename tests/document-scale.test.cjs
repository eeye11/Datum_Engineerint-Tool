 * ========================================================
 * DOES A LENGTH MEAN ANYTHING, AND DOES IT KEEP MEANING IT?
 * ========================================================
 *
 * A drawing's coordinates are numbers until somebody says how big one of them
 * is. The FIRST dimension is what says so: the student measures something they
 * can put a ruler against, and tells the application what it really is. From
 * then on every length in the document is interpretable.
 *
 * THE RULE THIS FILE EXISTS TO HOLD
 *
 *     Screen pixels are never engineering truth.
 *
 * A 500 mm beam is 500 mm at every zoom level and under every pan. Zoom and
 * pan decide how large the geometry APPEARS; they are a property of the camera
 * and must never reach the model. Vector Scale is the same kind of thing -
 * it is how big an arrow is drawn, and a 0.5x arrow is still 100 N.
 *
 * The arithmetic here is small; what is worth pinning is that the conversions
 * are read from the MODEL and never from the viewport, because every way this
 * can go wrong looks like a number that is merely slightly off.
