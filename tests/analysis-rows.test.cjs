/*
 * THE ANALYSIS ROWS OF THE MAPPING TABLE.
 *
 * The specification's mapping table ends with five analysis rows:
 * Resultant, Force Components, SFD, BMD and AFD. What exists today is
 * uneven across them, and this file records exactly where the line is
 * rather than leaving it to be discovered.
 *
 * SPLIT THREE WAYS:
 *
 *   1. THE ANNOTATION LAYER SUPPORTS Resultant and Force Components.
 *      Both resolve their source feature and update from it - a force
 *      of 250 N at -90 degrees reads "Fx = 0.000 N, Fy = -250.0 N",
 *      and turning it to 30 degrees reads "Fx = 216.5 N, Fy = 125.0 N".
 *      That is the §29 behaviour working, and it is asserted below.
 *
 *   2. NO FEATURE TYPE PRODUCES THEM. `resultant` and
 *      `force-components` compute a value and show it in the status
 *      line; they add nothing to the drawing. So the two annotation
 *      kinds above are correct but currently unreachable from the UI -
 *      there is no resultant object on the sheet to attach one to.
 *      That is a FEATURE gap, not a dimension or annotation one, and it
 *      is out of scope for this system.
 *
 *   3. SFD, BMD AND AFD ARE REAL FEATURE TYPES. `shear-force-diagram`,
 *      `bending-moment-diagram` and `axial-force-diagram` each have a
 *      factory, a tool, a Feature Panel and a dependency relationship to
 *      their source body, and the plot editor that draws them is shared.
 *      The ANALYSIS rows below assert the annotation half - what a
 *      resultant and a components pair SAY - because that is what this
 *      file can reach as pure modules. The diagram features themselves
 *      are covered by the browser verification and by the panel tests.
 *
 * A NOTE ON WHAT ENGGDRAW DOES NOT DO. It does not COMPUTE shear,
 * bending or axial values, and it does not infer the student's
 * solution. The diagrams are drawn from expressions the student enters,
 * against a source body whose length and events the application derives
 * from the geometry - which is the distinction the analysis philosophy
 * rests on.
 *
 * So this file asserts what genuinely works, and says plainly which
 * rows are not covered rather than quietly omitting them.
 *
 * Pure modules, so this runs in Node.
