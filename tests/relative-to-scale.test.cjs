 * ========================================================
 * RELATIVE TO IS A MEASUREMENT IN BOTH DIRECTIONS
 * ========================================================
 *
 * `Relative To` says how far a child sits from the parent it belongs to, and it
 * is PRINTED in millimetres, because the panel prints every physical quantity
 * that way.
 *
 * It has to be READ and WRITTEN under the same conversion. Reading it through
 * the sheet's Universal Length Scale while writing it straight into world
 * coordinates would place the child somewhere the number on screen never
 * described - and the row would stop being the measurement it claims to let you
 * edit. On a sheet calibrated to anything but 1:1 the error is large and
 * immediate; on an uncalibrated sheet it hides, which is why it survived.
 *
 * So the rule this file holds is narrow and checkable:
 *
 *     What the panel prints is exactly what the panel accepts.
 *
 * It is asserted at source level, between markers that delimit the relative
 * branch of the writer, because a same-named conversion elsewhere in a
 * 21k-line file must not be able to satisfy it.
