/*
 * ONE RENDERER FOR EVERY OUTPUT.
 *
 * The specification is unusually firm about this: dimensions and
 * annotations "must use the same clean drawing-rendering pipeline as the
 * rest of the drawing", and it explicitly forbids "separate visual
 * implementations for each output".
 *
 * That is a rule about the SHAPE of the code, not about what appears on
 * screen, so it is enforced structurally rather than by comparing
 * pixels.
 *
 * The failure it guards against is quiet. A dimension is added to the
 * canvas renderer, and someone later hand-draws a version for the
 * export path. That looks right right up until the two drift apart - a
 * missing arrowhead style, a text frame at a different size, an
 * annotation exported without its leader - and nothing fails, because
 * each version is correct about itself.
 *
 * So each output module is checked for two things:
 *
 *   1. it REACHES the shared renderer, and
 *   2. it does not BUILD SVG geometry of its own.
 *
 * The second is what makes the first meaningful: a module that both
 * delegates and hand-draws has the problem in miniature.
 *
 * An earlier version of this file drove the outputs with a stubbed
 * renderer at runtime. That was abandoned. It needed a dozen editor
 * services injected before it reached the draw, and every one missing
 * surfaced as "the renderer was never called" - indistinguishable from
 * the very thing being guarded against. The behaviour itself is
 * verified in the browser instead, where an exported SVG and a Drawing
 * Reference were each checked to contain the dimension's measured
 * value.
