/*
 * ========================================================

 * ========================================================
 *
 * TWO THINGS MUST BOTH BE TRUE, and they pull against each other:
 *
 *   1. Opening replaces the drawing, so it must ask about unsaved changes
 *      FIRST - and the work must run INSIDE the answer, not around it. The old
 *      bug handed the guard an empty action and then returned early on the
 *      guard's synchronous `false` (the answer has not arrived yet), so Open
 *      aborted every time the document was dirty and the chosen file was read
 *      and thrown away.
 *
 *   2. File -> Open must NOT open the operating system's panel directly. It
 *      shows the Datum launcher - Templates, Recent, Import - and the panel is
 *      reached only through Import.
 *
 * The checks that read source do so through plain substring searches
 * (`includes`), not regular expressions, because the defect is a SHAPE of code
 * and a literal string is both clearer to read here and impossible to get
 * subtly wrong with escaping.
