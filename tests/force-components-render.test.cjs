/*
 * DO THE COMPONENT ARROWHEADS POINT ALONG THEIR COMPONENTS?
 *
 * The arithmetic is already proven correct - 50 checks over every
 * quadrant, every zero case, and the sum back to the original. So
 * `derived.x.x` is the right number, and the reported BACKWARD ARROWHEADS
 * can only be a drawing fault: the renderer is placing the head at the
 * wrong end of the segment, or deriving the head from a screen-space
 * segment that runs the other way.
 *
 * The difference matters and is worth stating. A component is a SIGNED
 * vector. +Fx and -Fx have identical lengths and opposite directions, so
 * any test that compares lengths, or that compares magnitudes, will find
 * them equal and pass. The only thing that tells them apart is WHERE THE
 * TIP IS.
 *
 * So the tip position is what is measured: the head of each component
 * arrow must sit at the far end of that component's own shaft, in the
 * direction of the component's own sign.
