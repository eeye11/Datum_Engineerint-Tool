/*
 * ========================================================
 * CAN ONE FORCE HAVE ITS MAGNITUDE BOX AND ANOTHER NOT?
 * ========================================================
 *
 * A beam diagram with twenty forces is unreadable with twenty magnitude boxes
 * on it, and turning the whole class off to cope means also losing the three
 * that mattered. So there are two switches, and the relationship between them
 * is the whole design:
 *
 *   THE GLOBAL ONE asks whether magnitudes are wanted on this sheet at all.
 *   THE PER-FEATURE ONE asks whether THIS feature's box is wanted, on a sheet
 *   where they are.
 *
 * The per-feature switch may only ever narrow the global one. That is the part
 * worth testing, because both directions of the obvious mistake are available:
 *
 *   - If the feature's choice were IGNORED, the individual toggles would be
 *     decoration and the student would turn one off and watch nothing happen.
 *   - If the feature's choice were ANDed with the global one, the student
 *     could switch magnitudes on globally, turn one force off, turn magnitudes
 *     off and on again, and find their individual choice silently forgotten.
 *
 * The second is the subtler one, and it is why the preference lives on the
 * feature rather than being derived from the global switch every frame.
 *
 * The engineering rule underneath all of it: none of this touches the force.
 * Showing a box and hiding a box are both presentation.
