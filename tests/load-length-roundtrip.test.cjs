/*
 * The Features panel's Length field is the load's engineering span.
 *
 * WHAT IS ASSERTED, AND WHY IT IS ASSERTED HERE.
 *
 * A student typing "100 mm" is stating a REAL LENGTH, so the distance
 * between the load's defining points must become exactly 100 mm on the
 * sheet and the panel must report 100 mm straight back. Every fault the
 * specification lists as must-not-happen - a value scaled twice, a value
 * scaled not at all, a value that survives only until the next render -
 * shows up as a disagreement between what was typed and what the panel
 * reads afterwards.
 *
 * So the test drives the two halves that must agree and checks the pair:
 *
 *   1. the panel half - `scalar("Length", ...)` is shown as an engineering
 *      length, and the setter converts it exactly once (see
 *      SETTER_OWNED_LENGTHS in drawing.js, which keeps the input path from
 *      converting a value the setter is already converting);
 *   2. the geometry half - the authoritative endpoint update, taken from
 *      drawing.js's own shape rather than invented here, so the test cannot
 *      pass while the application does something else.
 *
 * The scale is deliberately varied: an uncalibrated sheet, a sheet at
 * 4 mm per unit and a sheet at 0.25 mm per unit. A conversion applied in
 * the wrong place is invisible at 1:1 and wrong everywhere else, which is
 * exactly how a scale fault survives a suite that only draws at 1:1.
