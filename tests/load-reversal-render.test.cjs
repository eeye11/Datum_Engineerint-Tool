/*
 * DOES A REVERSED LOAD STILL HAVE ITS OUTLINE?
 *
 * The model is fine: `reverseLoadDirection` touches one boolean and a test
 * proves no span, endpoint, intensity or attachment moves. So the reported
 * fault - a reversal that "loses or moves the outline at the arrow ends" -
 * cannot be in the model, and has to be in what gets DRAWN.
 *
 * That is what this file renders. It builds a load, renders it, reverses
 * it, renders it again, and compares the two drawings field by field.
 *
 * The comparison is the point. Not "does something render" - a lost
 * outline still leaves most of the load on screen, so a load that draws
 * anything at all would pass that. What has to hold is that the set of
 * drawn marks is the SAME set, with only the arrowheads moved to the far
 * end of each vector. One fewer outline stroke is invisible in a
 * screenshot and obvious in a count.
