/*
 * The ANGULAR dimension's drawn arc, tested directly.
 *
 * This exists because of a bug that no existing assertion could see.
 * An angular dimension reported the right NUMBER and drew a visibly
 * wrong ARC beside it: two lines meeting at a corner produced a
 * dimension reading 57.57 degrees whose arc swept 151 degrees. Both
 * halves were "correct" on their own terms, and every test that
 * checked the value passed.
 *
 * The cause was in how the legs were taken. The angle is drawn about
 * the vertex where the two spans meet - and when two spans are drawn
 * to a shared corner, that vertex IS one end of each span. Asking for
 * the direction from the vertex toward that same end gives a vector of
 * length zero, from which no arc can be built, so the tessellation ran
 * off on whatever degenerate direction it was handed.
 *
 * So the assertion here is that the DRAWN ARC SUBTENDS THE SAME ANGLE
 * AS THE LABEL. That is the property a reader relies on and the one
 * neither half checked alone.
 *
 * Pure module, so it runs in Node.
