/*
 * The feature factories for dimensions and annotations, tested directly.
 *
 * These exist because of a bug that was invisible from every other
 * angle. A dimension created through the factory was a perfectly
 * well-formed feature: it was named, numbered, selectable, savable
 * and undoable, and it appeared in the Features list. It simply drew
 * nothing and could not be measured.
 *
 * The reason was a shape mismatch. The factory put a dimension's
 * measurement under `content`, while the dimension model reads
 * `dimension.sourceRefs` and `dimension.placement` straight off the
 * feature. Every lookup landed on undefined, so the measurement
 * resolved to nothing. Because nothing THREW, no error surfaced
 * anywhere - the dimension was just quietly empty.
 *
 * The same applied to annotations, whose model reads its own
 * `textMode`, `sourceFeatureId` and `placement` the same way. An
 * annotation created through the factory could not resolve its source
 * feature, so it could not update when that feature changed.
 *
 * So the assertions here are about SHAPE, not about drawing: that the
 * model can find what it needs on a feature the factory actually
 * built. A test that only checked "a dimension was created" would have
 * passed throughout.
 *
 * Pure module, so it runs in Node.
