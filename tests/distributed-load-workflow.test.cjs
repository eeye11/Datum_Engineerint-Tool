 * ========================================================
 * THE DISTRIBUTED LOAD CREATION WORKFLOW
 * ========================================================
 *
 * Selecting a body used to mean "this load covers the whole body". The tool
 * filled the span from the body's own endpoints, drew arrows across it, and
 * asked for "magnitude and direction" in one instruction - which is not an
 * interaction, it is a summary of two.
 *
 * So the workflow is now explicit and sequential:
 *
 *   body → start → end → magnitude → direction → commit
 *
 * and the questions below are about the workflow rather than about geometry,
 * because the geometry was never the thing that was wrong.
 *
 * Read from the source rather than driven through a canvas: the state machine
 * lives inside drawing.js's IIFE and needs a real pointer sequence to run,
 * which this file cannot provide. What it CAN do is prove that the states
 * exist, that each has an instruction of its own, and that nothing commits
 * before the last one.
