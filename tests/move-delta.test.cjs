/*
 * DOES A FEATURE MOVE BY THE HANDLE, OR BY ITS OWN ARROW?
 *
 * Reported: features that "fly away from the cursor" when moved, most
 * noticeably on scaled-down force vectors - a force at 0.25x behaving as
 * though it were at 4x.
 *
 * The claim has a specific cause, and it is worth stating before testing
 * it, because it is the only way a display setting could affect a
 * translation. A move is a DELTA: current cursor minus where the cursor
 * was pressed. If that delta is computed in world units, no display scale
 * can touch it. If any part of it is derived from the feature's own drawn
 * extent - the arrow length, the vector scale - then a force drawn short
 * moves short, and the feature leaves the hand.
 *
 * So the test does not check that a feature "moves correctly", which a
 * single drag would satisfy whatever the mechanism. It moves the SAME
 * feature by the SAME world delta at four different vector scales, and
 * requires all four to land in the same place.
 *
 * A drag by handle is checked as well, and separately, because the
 * handle's own position is where the student grabbed the feature and it
 * must travel with the feature rather than staying at the press point.
