/*
 * ========================================================
 * DARK MODE INPUTS, AND THE PALETTE BENEATH EVERYTHING
 * ========================================================
 *
 * A dark interface with white fields in it is the single most common way a dark
 * theme is left unfinished, and it is the fault this pass exists to remove. So
 * these checks ask four questions of the real stylesheets:
 *
 *   1. IS ANY EDGE-EDITABLE FIELD LEFT WITH A HARDCODED LIGHT BACKGROUND? A
 *      form control is drawn by the BROWSER, and a rule that never sets its
 *      background leaves the browser's own white in place.
 *
 *   2. IS THE FOREGROUND SET WITH IT? Changing a background without the text
 *      colour is worse than leaving it white: the field LOOKS themed and the
 *      text cannot be read.
 *
 *   3. DOES `color-scheme` FOLLOW THE THEME? It is the only property that
 *      reaches the list of options inside a `<select>`, a date picker and a
 *      scrollbar - none of which any token can style.
 *
 *   4. IS THE DARK PALETTE FREE OF THE OLD BLUE-GREY? The theme before the Deep
 *      Teal & Ice palette was blue-grey (#202a30, #39454c, a #6fb4ff focus).
 *      The teal that replaced it is DELIBERATE and named, so the check is about
 *      the old values being gone rather than about "no blue anywhere".
