 * THE LOAD DIRECTION CAN BE SNAPPED TO WORLD VERTICAL / HORIZONTAL
 * ========================================================

 * The direction vector runs from the fixed reference point of the loaded
 * region to the cursor. For it to be EXACTLY vertical or horizontal, the
 * cursor has to be able to align with that reference through the shared
 * inference system - which is what these tests pin down.
 *
 * They drive the real resolver (`resolveConstructionPoint`) with the real
 * load interaction, so they test the reading the tool actually uses.
