/*
 * ========================================================
 * DIMENSIONS: EDITING, THE DRIVING VALUE, AND THE PREVIEW
 * ========================================================
 *
 * Four requirements, all about the same idea - a dimension is a LIVE reading of
 * geometry, and the box a student edits it in is the application's one value
 * box:
 *
 *   1. Double-clicking a dimension opens the STANDARD value popup and never
 *      the World Scale question.
 *   2. A Variable Dimension starts EMPTY and never shows the measured value.
 *   3. Its preview shows the dimension geometry, with no answer in it.
 *   4. A measured dimension stays DRIVING: its value is re-read from the
 *      geometry every frame, never frozen by the first entry.
