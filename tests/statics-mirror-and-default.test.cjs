 * ========================================================
 * MIRROR, AND THE DEFAULT TOOL
 * ========================================================
 *
 * Two things that came out of asking whether the general tools work for
 * every Statics feature.
 *
 * MIRROR HANDLED EVERYTHING EXCEPT THE ANALYSIS DIAGRAM.
 *
 * `mirrorObjectAcrossLine` has a case for the beam, the truss, the force,
 * the load, the moment, the support, the connection and the rigid body. An
 * analysis diagram was not among them, so mirroring one produced a second
 * copy in exactly the same place - which looks precisely like the mirror
 * failing, with nothing to say so. That is the worst shape of miss: a tool
 * that appears to work and silently does the wrong thing.
 *
 * SELECT IS NOW NAMED RATHER THAN NULL.
 *
 * With `activeTool: null`, clicking already selected - but by falling
 * through every tool handler rather than by Select being active. Naming it
 * makes the default state an ordinary one.
