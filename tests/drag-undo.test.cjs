/*
 * A DRAG IS UNDOABLE, WHATEVER IT MOVED.
 *
 * This is a structural test, and it is worth being honest about why.
 *
 * The behaviour it guards lives in the editor's drag machinery, which
 * needs a live canvas, so it cannot be exercised from Node. It IS
 * exercised in the browser - an annotation is dragged, the source
 * feature is confirmed unmoved, the link is confirmed intact, and undo
 * is confirmed to put the label back - but that proof is not a
 * regression test, because nobody re-runs it.
 *
 * So the shape of the code is pinned here instead.
 *
 * THE BUG
 * -------
 * The drag machinery snapshotted `object.geometry` and restored it on
 * undo. That is correct for a shape and silently wrong for everything
 * else, because plenty of features are not stored in geometry at all:
 *
 *   - an annotation's position is `placement`
 *   - a dimension's chosen offset is `placement`
 *
 * Moving either wrote to those fields, the undo entry held only
 * geometry, and restoring it left the moved object exactly where the
 * student had put it. Undo appeared to work - the drawing redrew, the
 * history advanced - while doing nothing to the thing the student was
 * trying to undo.
 *
 * Nothing threw and nothing looked wrong. That is the whole reason it
 * is pinned structurally.
