 * ========================================================
 * THE SKETCH EDITOR
 * ========================================================
 *
 * Sketch is the other half of the Analysis Editor: a Plot is entered as
 * equations, a Sketch is drawn by hand. Both are reached from the same
 * entry point, so this checks the two things that make it usable.
 *
 * ONLY FOUR TOOLS.
 *
 * The general Geometry toolbar is deliberately not offered. A student
 * sketching the shape of one diagram should find two points and a pen, not
 * forty tools - and a Rectangle here is a Line with one more click, so
 * nothing is lost by leaving it out.
 *
 * ENGINEERING, NOT PIXELS.
 *
 * The important property, and the one worth failing over: a point is
 * stored as an (x, y) in the graph's own coordinate system, so a sketch
 * made at one zoom reads identically at another. The test round-trips a
 * point through the scale rather than asserting a screen number, because
 * asserting a screen number would pass even if the scale were wrong in a
 * way that happened to cancel out.
