/*
 * ========================================================
 * RESPONSIVE LAYOUT: THE INVARIANTS, IN THE SOURCE
 * ========================================================
 *
 * These rules are easy to break by accident - a stray `flex-wrap: wrap`, or
 * a `display: none` on a panel - and a broken one does not throw, it just
 * quietly makes the drawing unusable on a narrow screen. So the properties
 * that MATTER are read out of the stylesheet and stated here.
 *
 * The rules the responsive work has to keep:
 *
 *   1. The top toolbar is ONE ROW that scrolls - it never wraps.
 *   2. The section bar is ONE ROW that scrolls - it never wraps.
 *   3. Neither panel is ever `display: none`d by a width breakpoint.
 *   4. The panels switch to an icon-only form at a narrow width, driven by
 *      the VIEWPORT (a media query), not by a device check.
 *   5. The workspace clamps its width, so a panel cannot make the whole
 *      page scroll sideways.
