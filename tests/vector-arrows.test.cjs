/*
 * ========================================================
 * DOES A VECTOR POINT WHERE IT POINTS?
 * ========================================================
 *
 * Statics vectors - a Point Force, a Resultant, the three vectors of a Force
 * Components - were drawn by two separate routines. One took two points and
 * measured the difference. The other took an ANGLE and rebuilt the tip:
 *
 *     y: anchor.y - Math.sin(radians) * length
 *
 * That leading minus is wrong: `anchor` is a screen point, screen y grows
 * downward, and by the time a point is being placed the inversion has
 * already happened inside the projection. The caller compensated by handing
 * in a negated angle, so the two errors cancelled and the drawing happened
 * to be right.
 *
 * Two wrongs in one place is not a working arrangement. It cannot be
 * changed, cannot be reused for a new vector type, and cannot be reasoned
 * about without first working out which of the two signs is wrong in a
 * given quadrant. The shared arrow now takes the two points and measures
 * its own direction, so there is no sign left to get wrong.
 *
 * The test renders real forces through the real renderer and asks the only
 * question that matters: does the arrowhead sit on the side of the
 * application point the engineering vector says it should?
