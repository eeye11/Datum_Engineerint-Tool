/*
 * ========================================================
 * DRAW ORDER
 * ========================================================
 *
 * Which feature is drawn on top of which. Two rules, and the second is the one
 * worth failing over:
 *
 *   1. THE ORDER IS THE ARRAY. The renderer walks `state.objects` in order, so
 *      draw order is the position in the one list the whole application uses -
 *      not a second `zIndex` field that could disagree with it.
 *
 *   2. DRAW ORDER DOES NOT AFFECT SELECTION. Sending a feature to the back
 *      changes what covers it and nothing else: it must still be picked by a
 *      click, still be found by a selection rectangle, and still be listed in
 *      the feature tree. A visual change must never become data loss or a
 *      feature that cannot be reached.

 * the real behaviour is exercised in the browser probe. What is asserted here
