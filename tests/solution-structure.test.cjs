/*
 * ========================================================
 * THE WRITTEN SOLUTION'S OUTLINE, PARSED FROM ITS SOURCE
 * ========================================================
 *
 * The workspace shows THREE views of one document: the outline, the editor and
 * the preview. There is one source, and the outline is DERIVED from it - so the
 * parsing is the part worth pinning, because a wrong parse is an outline that
 * disagrees with the text beside it.
 *
 * These check the three things that make the outline usable:
 *
 *   the HIERARCHY   a subsection is one level in, under its section
 *   the NUMBERING   sections number 1, 1.1, 1.2, 2 - and problems are their own
 *                   series, so a problem does not push the first section to "2"
 *   the LINE        every row knows which line to jump to
