/*
 * ========================================================
 * THE INTERFACE IS STYLED THROUGH TOKENS, IN BOTH THEMES
 * ========================================================
 *
 * A theme is only complete if EVERY interface surface goes through a token. A
 * single hardcoded colour is a surface that stays light in dark mode, and the
 * fault is invisible until somebody switches.
 *
 * So this asserts, on the real stylesheets:
 *
 *   1. NO hex literal remains in the interface stylesheet - every colour is a
 *      token reference, so the palette is decided in one file;
 *   2. every token the interface USES is DEFINED, in the light theme and again
 *      in the dark theme and in the system block - a token defined only for
 *      light would silently fall back to nothing when the theme flips;
 *   3. the dark theme is a designed palette, not an inversion: the surfaces are
 *      not pure black and the accent is not the light theme's dark teal;
 *   4. the DRAWING is not themed - the drawing's own colours live in the model,
 *      never in these stylesheets.
 *
 * THE PALETTE IS DEEP TEAL & ICE. The accent is a TEAL (#087E83 light, #4DD0C5
 * dark) - green and blue close together, so it reads cool rather than as a green
 * - and the surfaces are an ice-mint on the light theme and a deep teal-charcoal
 * on the dark one.
