/*
 * ========================================================
 * THE GENERAL TOOLS, OVER EVERY STATICS FEATURE
 * ========================================================
 *
 * The request is that Select, Move, Mirror and the rest behave the same for
 * a beam as for a force, a support or an analysis diagram - that they are
 * general tools rather than tools that work for most of the sheet.
 *
 * This asks that question of the FEATURE GEOMETRY MODULE directly, because
 * that is where translate/rotate/mirror decide what a feature is. A tool
 * that never reaches them cannot move a feature; a type they do not
 * recognise cannot be moved at all. Anything reading a tool-specific list
 * of "movable types" is the same bug wearing a different hat, so the test
 * drives the geometry and checks the RESULT rather than reading the code
 * that should have caused it.
 *
 * The features are built by the real factories wherever one exists. A
 * hand-written object that the application cannot create describes nothing,
 * and would report a working feature as broken.
