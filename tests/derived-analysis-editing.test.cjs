/*
 * ========================================================
 * DOES A DRAGGED FEATURE STAY UNDER THE CURSOR?
 * ========================================================
 *
 * Two faults lived in the move, and both made a feature OVERTAKE the pointer
 * instead of following it - which is what "it flies off" described.
 *
 * THE FIRST: an ordinary feature was translated without being restored to its
 * pre-drag geometry first. The delta reaching the move is measured from where
 * the PRESS happened, not from the last pointermove, so the move is a SET -
 * "wherever you were, plus the total distance". Restoring the children but
 * not the feature itself meant each move added a full delta on top of the
 * previous one: three moves of ten units left the feature sixty units from the
 * cursor, and the gap grew with every further pixel.
 *
 * THE SECOND, specific to analysis objects: `placementOffset` was COMPOSED
 * rather than set, for the same reason - thirty on the first move, sixty on
 * the second, ninety on the third. And the geometry was translated inside the
 * analysis branch ON TOP OF the caller's own translation, moving it twice.
 *
 * BOTH WERE BUGS IN THE MOVE, NOT A REASON TO FORBID IT. A Force Components
 * and a Resultant are draggable - their numbers are re-derived from their
 * sources, so they record where the student put them and the refresh applies
 * that to whatever it derives. An earlier version of this file responded to
 * the flying-off report by refusing to move them at all, which hid the
 * symptom by removing the feature's capability. This file holds that line:
 * the features are draggable AND they land where the pointer is.
 *
 * `translateObject` is exercised through the real module, because the faults
 * were in what it does with a delta rather than in the shape of any model.
