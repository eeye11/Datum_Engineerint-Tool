/*
 * THE ANALYSIS AXIS OF A SLOPING BODY.
 *
 * §5 of the specification: the analysis coordinate system must use the
 * body's own engineering direction, so a Beam drawn at an angle produces
 * an axis at the same angle and its stations still line up along it.
 *
 * A screen-aligned axis would be horizontal whatever the member does, so
 * this checks the angle of the axis against the angle of the span it came
 * from, and checks that it is the same LENGTH - a diagram that is not the
 * same length as its beam is a different diagram, not a scaled one.
 *
 * It also pins the offset behaviour, because that is what keeps a placed
 * diagram where the student put it when the beam is later resized.
