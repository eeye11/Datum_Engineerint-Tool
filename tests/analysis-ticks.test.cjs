 * A gridded axis. This deliberately REVERSES a principle the renderer used
 * to hold - that a tick or a number on the axis "would be the tool
 * answering the exercise" - because reading a magnitude off a ruler is
 * doing the exercise, not having it done for you. The principle is
 * preserved in the check that still forbids a RANGE: the scale is the
 * student's, the application does not claim to know what the answer is.
 *
 * What matters here is that the ticks agree with the curve. A grid that
 * disagrees with the drawing is worse than no grid, because it is believed.
