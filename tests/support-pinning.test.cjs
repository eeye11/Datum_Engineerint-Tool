/*
 * ========================================================
 * DOES A SUPPORT STAY PINNED WHILE IT IS BEING MOVED?
 * ========================================================
 *
 * A support is attached to a MEMBER, not to a place on the sheet. Its position
 * is the fraction of the member it stands at, and that is what makes it
 * survive the member being resized, moved or rotated after the fact.
 *
 * IT USED TO UNPIN THE MOMENT IT WAS TOUCHED.
 *
 * The support's position handle wrote the raw cursor point straight into
 * `geometry.position` and then re-read the parent from wherever the pointer
 * happened to be. Because the symbol is drawn clear of the beam, the pointer
 * is almost never over the beam - so the re-read came back null, `parentId`
 * was cleared, and the support was orphaned on the first pointermove.
 *
 * Three symptoms, one cause:
 *
 *   - it turned into a cross, because with no parent the renderer had no
 *     member to resolve a position against and drew nothing it recognised;
 *   - it stopped being pinned to the body, since there was no longer a body;
 *   - it could be dragged anywhere, because there was nothing left to
 *     constrain it.
 *
 * The `position` handle is the entry point, and the check is that dragging it
 * changes WHERE ALONG THE MEMBER the support stands and nothing else - not the
 * world coordinate, and certainly not the parent.
 *
 * The behaviour under test is `applyStaticsManipulation`'s, so the source is
 * read and the branch is exercised through the same path a pointer takes.
