/*
 * ========================================================
 * LOAD DIRECTION IS SEPARATE FROM THE SPAN
 * ========================================================
 *
 * WHERE a load exists and HOW it is directed are two independent geometric
 * systems, for both distributed loads:
 *
 *   - the SPAN (start/end) and the PROFILE POINTS say where the load acts;
 *   - one FIXED reference point and the cursor say which way it pushes.
 *
 * The defects these tests pin down all come from the two systems leaking
 * into one another:
 *
 *   - moving the cursor along the span rotated the load, because the
 *     direction was measured from a point that moved (or from a snapped
 *     endpoint, which jumps to the end of the span);
 *   - a load could be committed with a direction nobody chose, because a
 *     placeholder angle was stored when the vector was empty;
 *   - an unknown direction still drew arrows, because the model fell back to
 *     a default the moment the value was marked unknown.
 *
 * These drive the real draft functions - the ones that turn an interaction
 * plus a cursor into the load - so they test the reading the preview and the
 * commit both use.
