/*
 * ========================================================
 * SMART DIMENSION ARMS WITHOUT ENTER - AND STILL TAKES A SECOND REFERENCE
 * ========================================================
 *
 * The INFERENCE was never the problem - `dimension-inference.js` already turns
 * two lines into an angle, and `smart-dimension-flow.test.cjs` covers that.
 *
 * The problem was the TOOL FLOW, and it had two halves that had to be solved
 * together:
 *
 *   1. `beginDimensionReferenceSelection` recorded the reference and reset the
 *      stage to "selecting" every time, so the measurement was only decided
 *      when Enter was pressed. A click that COMPLETES a measurement must move
 *      on at once, with no keystroke.
 *
 *   2. Throwing the tool STRAIGHT into placement on the first line fixed (1)
 *      but broke the angle: the very next click was read as "where to stand the
 *      length dimension", so a second line could never be picked.
 *
 * The answer is an ARMED stage. The first click on a measurable whole previews
 * its own measurement at once - no Enter - while the tool is STILL accepting a
 * second reference. A second reference upgrades the pair to their own
 * measurement (an angle between two lines, a distance between two points); a
 * click on empty space is the placement gesture.
 *
 * What still waits, honestly: a single POINT. A point has no length and a
 * distance needs a partner, so there is genuinely nothing to preview.
