/*
 * ========================================================
 * A MAGNITUDE BOX IS A BOX, NOT A PART OF THE FORCE
 * ========================================================
 *
 * `F = 100 N` printed across an arrowhead is unreadable, so the box has to
 * be movable. But the box is DERIVED from the force - it is not a feature,
 * and storing its text would give two copies of one number free to
 * disagree.
 *
 * The division that works:
 *
 *   THE TEXT IS DERIVED.  Recomputed from the force every frame, so it
 *                         cannot go stale and cannot be dragged into
 *                         disagreeing with the force it belongs to.
 *   THE PLACE IS STORED.  An offset on the feature, which is the only part
 *                         the student chose and the only part the
 *                         application has no opinion about.
 *
 * So editing the force moves the NUMBER and editing the box moves the box,
 * and neither can affect the other.
