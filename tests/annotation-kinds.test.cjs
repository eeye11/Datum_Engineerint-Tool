/*
 * WHICH LABELS A FEATURE CAN CARRY.
 *
 * `kindsFor` answers "what may be written on this feature", and the
 * Annotation tool is built on it - it offers exactly what it returns.
 * So the two have to agree: offering a kind that produces nothing draws
 * an empty box, and withholding one that would work leaves the student
 * with no way to label something they are looking at.
 *
 * The interesting cases here are the ones the obvious implementation
 * gets wrong.
 *
 * PROBING IS NOT ENOUGH ON ITS OWN
 * -------------------------------
 * The natural implementation asks each kind whether it can produce text
 * for this feature. That works until two kinds of feature share a
 * datum: a moment holds a magnitude, just as a force does, so a probe
 * would happily hand a moment the force label and print "F = 500 N"
 * about it - calling a moment a force, and meaning it.
 *
 * So a kind also DECLARES what it describes. That is what tells a force
 * from a moment; the probe only says whether the text came out
 * non-empty.
 *
 * Pure modules, so this runs in Node.
