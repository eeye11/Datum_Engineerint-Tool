/*
 * ========================================================
 * CAN ONE PROPERTY BE BOUND TO TWO FIELDS AT ONCE?
 * ========================================================
 *
 * The Cable panel rendered its Span and its Length with the same data-property
 * key. Two inputs, one binding: typing into either silently overwrote the
 * other, and nothing on the panel said so. For a STRAIGHT cable the two
 * numbers are equal, so it looked harmless - which is exactly why it survived
 * - and it only becomes visibly wrong when a cable is drawn with sag and the
 * two quantities stop agreeing.
 *
 * That is a generalisable fault, not a one-off, so it is checked generally:
 * within one panel branch, two editable fields must not claim one property.
 *
 * The second half checks the same class of mistake in the other direction -
 * a value that is measured rather than typed must SAY SO. An Angle reading
 * "0.00" on a panel that also states a Length in millimetres is ambiguous,
 * and three angle fields were carrying a middot separator where the degree
 * sign belonged.
