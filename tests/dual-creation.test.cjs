/*
 * ========================================================
 * BOTH CREATION INTERACTIONS, AT THE LEVEL OF THE DECISION
 * ========================================================
 *
 * The click-vs-drag question is answered in one small place, and it is worth
 * testing directly: the harness cannot reliably deliver pointer events to the
 * canvas, but the DECISION is pure logic.
 *
 * THE BUG THIS PINS DOWN. The press started the feature AND armed a drag
 * session, and the release completed it unconditionally - so a plain CLICK was
 * completed on release AT ITS OWN START POINT. A zero-length line, committed,
 * before the student had moved. Click-move-click was therefore impossible:
 * every first click created something.
 *
 * The gesture is now classified on release by how far the pointer travelled.
