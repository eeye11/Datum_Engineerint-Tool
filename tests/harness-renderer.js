/*
 * ========================================================
 * RUNNING THE RENDERER OUTSIDE A BROWSER
 * ========================================================
 *
 * In a browser every `<script>` shares one global scope, so a module can refer
 * to another by its bare name - `enggLoadProfile.drawnForceEnd(...)` - and find
 * it, because the file that published it onto `window` ran in the same scope.
 * That is how the renderer reaches the Statics profile, the body frames, the
 * feature geometry and the drawing state.
 *
 * UNDER `require` THERE IS NO SHARED SCOPE. Each module is its own function
 * with its own closure, so a bare `enggLoadProfile` is a ReferenceError the
 * first time a feature is drawn - and it fails as "not defined" rather than
 * as "the drawing is wrong", which is a misleading way to fail.
 *
 * So the published names are mirrored onto the global object before anything
 * is drawn. That is a HARNESS arrangement, not a change to the application:
 * the browser needs none of it, and adding it to the renderer itself would
 * have papered over a real coupling.
 *
 * Used by every test that renders, so the list of modules the renderer
 * reaches for is written down once. Adding a module the renderer depends on
 * means adding it here, and the failure it prevents is immediate and obvious.
