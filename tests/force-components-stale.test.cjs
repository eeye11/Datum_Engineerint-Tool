 * DO THE COMPONENTS FOLLOW THEIR FORCE?

 * Reported: components that do not update when the source force moves, is
 * dragged, or has its magnitude, direction or unit changed - "stale
 * geometry" that survives the change it should have followed.
 *
 * The derivation and the drawing are already proven correct by the other
 * two files. What is in question here is a different thing: whether the
 * components are a READING of the force or a SNAPSHOT of it. A snapshot
 * is correct once, at the moment it is taken, and wrong for ever after -
 * and it looks perfect right up until the force is moved.
 *
 * So every field is changed on the source in turn, and the components are
 * refreshed, and the three vectors are compared against what the source
 * NOW says. The check is against a fresh derivation rather than against
 * the numbers this file happens to know, so a change the test did not
 * anticipate is still caught.
