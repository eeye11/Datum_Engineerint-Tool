/*
 * ========================================================
 * THE VIEW MENU'S VISIBILITY SWITCHES
 * ========================================================
 *
 * Two things the user asked for, and one defect found while checking them:
 *
 *   1. THE LABEL NAMES WHAT THE COMMAND WILL DO. "Hide Grid" while the grid is
 *      up, "Show Grid" while it is down - so the menu states the effect rather
 *      than the current state.
 *
 *   2. NO TICK. The tick and the verb were saying the same thing twice.
 *
 *   3. AND THE LABEL HAS TO FOLLOW THE REAL STATE. The grid is a CANVAS switch:
 *      its visibility lives on `state.grid.visible`, not on
 *      `state.display.showGrid` with the annotation settings. The item was
 *      reading the wrong field, so its label never changed - the menu said
 *      "Hide Grid" whatever the grid was doing.
