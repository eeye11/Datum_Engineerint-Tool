 * When nothing is snapped, the snap half must be gone entirely - not a
 * separator, not a bullet, not a leftover "Horizontal" from a position the
 * cursor left thirty seconds ago.
 *
 * The message builder already filters empty labels, so the interesting
 * question is what it is GIVEN: a resolution whose `inference` and
 * `snapCandidate` still describe the previous cursor position would produce
 * a stale suffix that reads as though the snap were still live.
 *
 * These check the message builder against the shapes a resolution can take,
 * because that is where the answer is decided.
