# Datum

Datum is where an engineering student writes up a solution: the **written
working** (LaTeX, usually produced by the OCR tool from a handwritten page)
and the **drawings** it refers to — free body diagrams, beams and trusses,
loads and supports, dimensions, and shear-force, bending-moment and
axial-force diagrams. The two are submitted together to the autograder.

```

```

## For students

Open Datum in a web browser. Nothing to install.

- **Written Solution** — paste or correct your LaTeX on the left, see it
  rendered on the right. Put a drawing in your solution with *Insert Reference*.
- **Engineering Drawing** — choose a toolset across the top (Geometry,
  Annotate, Statics…), then a tool on the left. The status bar at the bottom
  always says what the current tool expects next. `Esc` cancels, `Ctrl+Z`
  undoes.
- **Save** keeps your work as a `.enggdraw` file you can open again later.
  Datum also keeps a recovery copy in your browser in case the tab closes.

## For developers

Requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 22.12 or newer.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:5173, reloads as you edit
npm test           # unit and integration tests (node:test)
npm run lint       # ESLint
npm run build      # static site in dist/ — host it anywhere
npm start          # serve dist/ plus TikZ rendering (optional server)
```

### Publishing

Every push to `main` builds the site and publishes it with GitHub Pages
(`.github/workflows/pages.yml`), at
`https://<owner>.github.io/Datum_Engineerint-Tool/`. A repository admin
turns this on once: **Settings → Pages → Source: GitHub Actions**. The
build is plain static files, so `dist/` can equally be copied to any web
host, including a university one, at any path.

### Checking a change

`npm run test:golden -- <url> <out.json>` drives the running app through every
tool in Chrome and records what it produced. Recording before and after a
change, then `node tests/e2e/golden-compare.mjs before.json after.json`,
shows exactly what the change did. See [docs/TESTING.md](docs/TESTING.md).

### Where things are

```
index.html            the page
src/main.js           the application entry point
src/editor/           the drawing editor — editor/index.js lists every part
src/core/             geometry, units, scale, the document model, snapping
src/features/         dimensions, annotations, analysis
src/rendering/        drawing the document as SVG
src/sheets/           sheets and the sheet tab bar
src/file/             save, open, export, crash recovery
src/solution/         the Written Solution tab
src/references/       drawing references (a sheet placed in the solution)
src/ui/               shared panel and dialog components
src/api/              the integration API — the only supported entry for other tools
src/styles/           tokens.css (colours, type), base, editor, shell
server/               optional Node server (TikZ → SVG)
tests/                node:test suites; tests/e2e/ browser scenarios
docs/                 architecture, integration, file format, testing
tools/                developer scripts (refactoring codemods, audits, QA)
```

Read [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) before changing the code,
and [docs/TOOL-MAP.md](docs/TOOL-MAP.md) to find where a toolbar command lives.

## For other tools

Datum exposes a small, versioned API — in the page as `window.datum`, and to
an embedding page over `postMessage` — for reading and loading documents,
rendering a sheet to SVG, and reading or setting the LaTeX solution. See
[docs/INTEGRATION.md](docs/INTEGRATION.md). The saved-file format is
specified in [docs/FILE-FORMAT.md](docs/FILE-FORMAT.md).

## Design principles

- **Datum documents; it does not solve.** The analysis tools help a student
  draw and label their own reasoning. Nothing works out an unknown or
  reports a solution.
- **A dimension measures geometry; an annotation states meaning.** A beam's
  length is a dimension of the geometry; "250 N at 30°" is an annotation.
- **A reference is not a picture.** A drawing in the written solution is
  rendered from the sheet's current contents every time.
