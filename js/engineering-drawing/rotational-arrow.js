/* Engineering drawing rotational arrow geometry - the ONE curved arrow. */
/*
 * A Moment and a Couple Moment are the same drawing: a centre, a
 * radius, a direction of sweep, and an arrowhead sitting on the
 * curve. Before this module each of them grew its own arc, its own
 * hardcoded radius and its own idea of which way the head pointed,
 * and the two drifted apart until a Moment read as a circle and a
 * Couple read as a pair of straight forces.
 *
 * So the geometry is derived once, here, and both features read it.
 * Nothing in this file draws: it answers questions about an arc, and
 * the renderer turns those answers into SVG. That split is what lets
 * the hit test in drawing.js measure the SAME curve the student can
 * see, instead of approximating it a second time and disagreeing.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS NOT
 * ----------------
 * None of this is engineering arithmetic. The radius here is a
 * PRESENTATION property, in screen pixels, and it is deliberately
 * not the moment's magnitude: a 500 N-m moment and a 5 N-m moment
 * are drawn at the same size, because a drawing shows which way
 * something turns, not how hard. The magnitude lives on the
 * feature's own `magnitude` field and is never read here.
