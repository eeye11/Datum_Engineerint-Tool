/*
 * Drawing sheets: the first-class parts an EnggDraw document is made of.
 *
 * A document is not one drawing, it is an ordered list of drawings. A
 * structural problem, its free body diagram, its shear force diagram
 * and its bending moment diagram are four separate sheets, each with
 * its own features, its own view and its own grid - and a sheet is a
 * thing a student can rename, duplicate, reorder and delete, exactly
 * like a worksheet in Excel.
 *
 * THE TWO IDENTITIES
 * ------------------
 * Every sheet carries TWO names, and keeping them apart is the whole
 * reason this module exists:
 *
 *   id    "sheet_8f31a"    permanent, minted once, never changes
 *   name  "Free Body Diagram"   what the user typed, changes freely
 *
 * Anything that points AT a sheet - a figure reference in the written
 * solution, a cross-reference, a caption - points at the id. The name
 * is a label the user is free to change at any moment, so a reference
 * built on it would silently start pointing at nothing the first time
 * somebody tidied up their tabs. The id is never reassigned, not on
 * rename, not on reorder, not on duplicate (a duplicate mints a new
 * one), so a reference made today still resolves in a file saved next
 * year.
 *
 * WHY SHEETS OWN THEIR CONTENT
 * ----------------------------
 * A sheet carries a full copy of the drawing state: its features, its
 * parent/child links, its units, its snapping, its style defaults, its
 * camera and its grid. Not "its own geometry" - its own EVERYTHING.
 * That is what makes switching sheets feel like switching documents
 * rather than hiding things, and it is why two sheets can show the
 * same figure at completely different zooms without either one
 * knowing the other exists.
 *
 * The live editor works on ONE sheet at a time. Rather than teach
 * every feature, every snapping candidate and every hit-test about
 * sheets - which would mean threading a sheet filter through thousands
 * of lines that have no business knowing - the editor loads the active
 * sheet's content into the single state it already has, and switching
 * sheets saves what is in that state back onto the sheet it came from
 * and loads the next one in. The consequence is the guarantee we
 * actually need: an inactive sheet has nothing in the editor at all,
 * so it cannot be selected, snapped to, dragged, or accidentally
 * modified by a tool that was still active when the user switched.
 *
 * The editor owns the live state object; this module owns the
 * collection and the rules about it. Neither knows about files.
