	 * THE ANALYSIS ICONS.
	 *
	 * One family, five members, built from the same parts: a 20x20
	 * viewBox, the shared iconStroke, round caps and joins, no fills,
	 * and a common 10,10 origin. They are meant to be read at about
	 * twenty pixels in a toolbar, so each is built from at most three
	 * strokes and none of them from a chart metaphor.
	 *
	 * What they say, in the student's own language:
	 *
	 *   Force Components  one force, split into two
	 *   Resultant         two forces, combined into one
	 *   SFD               shear, which JUMPS - a stepped profile
	 *   BMD               moment, which CURVES - a smooth bow
	 *   AFD               axial force, in blocks about the axis
	 *
	 * The last three are the ones that had to be told apart, and they
	 * are separated by exactly the property that separates the real
	 * diagrams: SFD is discontinuous, BMD is smooth, AFD is a block
	 * diagram on a member axis. Stepped-versus-curved is the
	 * difference a structural engineer looks for, so it is the
	 * difference drawn here.
	 *
	 * These are ICONS, not example solutions. They show the shape a
	 * diagram takes, never a value, so a student cannot read an
	 * answer off the toolbar.
