 * Crash recovery.
 *
 * A drawing that exists only in the browser's memory is one closed
 * tab away from being gone, and the usual case for losing work is
 * not a deliberate discard - it is a reload, a crash, or a laptop
 * that slept. So the current document is mirrored into local
 * storage as it is worked on.
 *
 * This is NOT the project's file. It has no name, it is never
 * downloaded, and it is deliberately of no consequence to anyone but
 * the person who made it. Sharing a drawing is the .enggdraw file's
 * job and always will be; this exists only so that a mishap does
 * not destroy work outright.
 *
 * What is kept is the same serialised document the file uses, so
 * recovering and opening a file go through exactly the same code
 * and cannot disagree about what a document is.
 *
 * The cost of the guarantee is kept low deliberately. The copy is
 * written on a pause rather than on every keystroke, because a drag
 * that mutates geometry continuously would otherwise write the
 * whole drawing to storage many times a second.
