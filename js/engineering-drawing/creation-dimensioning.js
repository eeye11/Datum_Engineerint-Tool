/*
 * ============================================================
 * CREATION-TIME DIMENSIONING
 * ============================================================
 *
 * The shared framework that lets ANY feature ask for its
 * physical size the moment it is created, and that lets the FIRST
 * such answer establish the document's engineering scale.
 *
 * ONE FRAMEWORK, NOT ONE PER TOOL
 * -------------------------------
 * A Beam, a Circle and a Rectangle are different shapes, but
 * asking for a size is the same act every time. So the popup, the
 * unit handling, the validation, the conversion and the
 * calibration rule all live here, and a tool supplies only the
 * one thing that is genuinely particular to it: WHICH dimensions
 * its geometry has, and what each one means.
 *
 * THE THREE THINGS THIS MODULE DECIDES
 * ------------------------------------
 *
 *   1. WHICH FEATURES HAVE A CREATION SIZE AT ALL.
 *      A Beam is a length. A Support is not, and a Point Force's
 *      meaningful quantities are a magnitude and a direction -
 *      none of which is a length. Asking a student for the
 *      "length" of a support would be asking them to invent a
 *      number that means nothing, so those features are
 *      classified out and never enter the workflow.
 *
 *   2. WHAT THOSE DIMENSIONS ARE, IN ENGINEERING TERMS.
 *      A Circle is asked for its Diameter, not its "X extent". A
 *      Rectangle is asked for its Width and its Height. The
 *      vocabulary is the one the drawing uses, so the popup and
 *      the Features panel name the same quantity the same way.
 *
 *   3. HOW A TYPED ENGINEERING VALUE BECOMES GEOMETRY.
 *      The value is converted through the ONE document scale
 *      (enggDimensions) into world units, and then applied by the
 *      SAME property setter the Features panel uses. There is no
 *      second conversion and no second setter, so the popup, the
 *      panel and a later Smart Dimension cannot disagree.
 *
 * THE CALIBRATION RULE
 * --------------------
 * The document has one engineering length scale, and it is
 * established exactly once:
 *
 *   FIRST creation dimension in an uncalibrated document
 *       -> establishes the scale, from the drawn geometry
 *   EVERY LATER creation dimension
 *       -> edits that feature's geometry using the scale
 *
 * A two-value shape obeys the same rule across its two fields:
 * the first value calibrates, the second is read against the
 * scale the first just established. Neither field ever creates a
 * second global scale.

  /*
   * ========================================================
   * THE FEATURE CLASSIFICATION
   * ========================================================
   *
   * Which features are asked for a creation size, and which
   * dimensions each one is asked for. This is the single
   * authoritative list; a tool does not describe its own popup,
   * it is described here, so two tools of the same shape cannot
   * drift into asking different questions.
   *
   * A definition is a list of DIMENSIONS. Each dimension names:
   *
   *   key        the geometry property the value is applied to,
   *              by the same name the Features panel uses
   *   label      what the student is asked for
   *   measure    how the CURRENT world value is read from the
   *              geometry, for the suggested starting value
   *
   * The order is the order they are asked in.
   *
   * A feature absent from this list is CATEGORY D: it has no
   * meaningful creation length, and no popup is shown for it.
   * That is the deliberate default - a new feature type is
   * silent until somebody says what its size means, rather than
   * inheriting a meaningless "Length" question.

   * APPLYING A CONFIRMED VALUE
   * ========================================================
   *
   * Turn a typed engineering value into world units and apply
   * it through the caller's property setter.
   *
   * The setter is passed in rather than reached for, so this
   * module never depends on drawing.js and can be tested on its
   * own - and so the ONE property setter stays the ONE property
   * setter. `apply(object, key, worldValue)` returns true when
   * the geometry accepted the change.
   *
   * `field.unit` is the unit THE STUDENT CHOSE, and it is passed
   * through to both conversions below unchanged. That is what
   * makes "0.5 m" and "500 mm" the same physical length: each is
   * read in the unit it was typed in, and both resolve to the same
   * millimetres through the ONE scale. The document's own unit is
   * only a fallback for a field that somehow arrived without one.
   *
   * CALIBRATION, AND WHY IT IS HERE
   * -------------------------------
   * If the document has no scale yet, THIS value is what
   * establishes it. The scale is derived from the geometry the
   * student actually drew, not from the value they typed:
   *
   *     mm per world unit = typed mm / drawn world units
   *
   * which is exactly the relationship the Smart Dimension's
   * calibration uses, through the same `enggDimensions.calibrate`
   * call. `calibrate` converts the typed value to millimetres
   * itself, so a first dimension of "0.5 m" establishes the same
   * scale as "500 mm" would. After that the value is applied in
   * world units through the same conversion, so the feature ends
   * up the size the student asked for under the scale that value
   * established.
   */
  /*
   * Turn a typed engineering value into the feature's authoritative
   * property.
   *
   * `apply(object, key, engineeringValue)` returns true when the
   * geometry accepted the change, and it is the caller's ONE
   * property setter - the same one the Features panel writes
   * through. That is what keeps the two routes from disagreeing.
   *
   * THE VALUE HANDED TO `apply` IS IN MILLIMETRES.
   * -------------------------------------------
   * The Features panel captions its length fields with a unit and
   * enters millimetres, so the setter accepts millimetres and does
   * the one conversion into world units. That means the number
   * crossing into the geometry has to ARRIVE in millimetres,
   * whatever unit the student typed it in.
   *
   * So a value typed as "0.5 m" becomes 500 mm here, by the factor
   * each unit declares against the millimetre, and `apply` receives
   * 500. This is a UNIT conversion only - it does not touch the
   * document scale, because the scale is not what turns metres into
   * millimetres.
   *
   * Converting through the scale as well was the bug this comment
   * exists to prevent: the value crossed the scale twice - once here
   * and once inside the setter - so a beam sized at 500 mm came out
   * five times too short and reported a fifth of the length the
   * student typed. One conversion, in one place, or the two routes
   * disagree about what a millimetre is.
   *
   * `field.unit` is the unit THE STUDENT CHOSEN, and it is what
   * establishes the scale below - which is what makes "0.5 m" and
   * "500 mm" the same physical length.
