/*
 * Smart Dimension: choosing what to measure.
 *
 * The ordinary Dimension tool makes the student decide what to
 * measure. Smart Dimension's whole job is that decision, so that a
 * student dimensioning a beam gets its span rather than being offered
 * nine options and asked to know which is conventional.
 *
 * IT IS NOT A SHORTCUT FOR THE DIMENSION TOOL
 * -------------------------------------------
 * It does not build a measurement and hand it over. It asks three
 * questions the other tool never has to:
 *
 *     what does this feature support?     the capability layer
 *     which of those is most useful HERE?  the rules below
 *     is it already stated?               the redundancy check
 *
 * Only the first is answered elsewhere. The second and third are what
 * make Smart Dimension worth choosing over Dimension, and both are
 * about judgement rather than about geometry.
 *
 * WHAT IT WILL NOT DO
 * -------------------
 * It will not produce more dimensions than the drawing needs. A
 * rectangle is not given a width, a height, a diagonal and two
 * corner-to-centre distances; a beam is not given its span, its depth
 * and both of those again. Over-dimensioning is a real defect in an
 * engineering drawing - it is the thing a checker marks down - so
 * preferring one good measurement to several complete ones is not a
 * simplification here, it is the correct behaviour.
 *
 * It also will not calculate anything. Every candidate is a
 * measurement of geometry that is already there. There is no
 * inference of a reaction, an equilibrium or a resultant anywhere in
 * this file, and the distinction is structural: this module only ever
 * asks the measurement layer what it can measure, and the measurement
 * layer knows how to measure a beam but not what a force does.
