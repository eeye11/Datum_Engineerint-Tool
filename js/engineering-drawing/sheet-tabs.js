/*
 * The sheet tab bar.
 *
 * The bar sits under the drawing area and is part of the workspace
 * rather than part of the drawing: it uses the same panel styling as
 * the rest of EnggDraw, but it never sits inside the canvas, never
 * scales with the zoom, and never appears in an export or a reference.
 * That separation is the point of it being its own row - a worksheet
 * tab in Excel belongs to the workbook, not to the cell you are
 * looking at, and the same is true here.
 *
 * It stays reachable at all times, including while a tool is active,
 * because switching sheets is not a drawing operation and must not
 * require putting the current tool down first.
 *
 * A tab can be:
 *   - clicked        to make that sheet active
 *   - clicked again  (or double-clicked) to rename it
 *   - dragged        to reorder it
 *   - right-clicked  for rename / duplicate / delete / move
 *
 * Every one of those acts on a sheet ID and never on a position, which
 * is what makes reordering safe for the references pointing at them.
 *
 * NOT PART OF THE DRAWING
 * -----------------------
 * Nothing in this file reads or writes a camera, a zoom or a pan. The
 * tabs are an application overlay: they are positioned in SCREEN
 * coordinates and are not part of the drawing's transform. Zooming the
 * canvas changes what is drawn and nothing about this bar, and nothing
 * done to this bar changes the zoom.
